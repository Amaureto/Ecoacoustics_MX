abstract = {We compared the ability of three machine learning algorithms (linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, and support vector machines) to automate the classification of calls of nine frogs and three bird species. In addition, we tested two ways of characterizing each call to train/test the system. Calls were characterized with four standard call variables (minimum and maximum frequencies, call duration and maximum power) or eleven variables that included three standard call variables (minimum and maximum frequencies, call duration) and a coarse representation of call structure (frequency of maximum power in eight segments of the call). A total of 10,061 isolated calls were used to train/test the system. The average true positive rates for the three methods were: 94.95{\%} for support vector machine (0.94{\%} average false positive rate), 89.20{\%} for decision tree (1.25{\%} average false positive rate) and 71.45{\%} for linear discriminant analysis (1.98{\%} average false positive rate). There was no statistical difference in classification accuracy based on 4 or 11 call variables, but this efficient data reduction technique in conjunction with the high classification accuracy of the SVM is a promising combination for automated species identification by sound. By combining automated digital recording systems with our automated classification technique, we can greatly increase the temporal and spatial coverage of biodiversity data collection. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Traditionally, animal species diversity and abundance is assessed using a variety of methods that are generally costly, limited in space and time, and most importantly, they rarely include a permanent record. Given the urgency of climate change and the loss of habitat, it is vital that we use new technologies to improve and expand global biodiversity monitoring to thousands of sites around the world. In this article, we describe the acoustical component of the Automated Remote Biodiversity Monitoring Network (ARBIMON), a novel combination of hardware and software for automating data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on audio recordings. The major components of the cyberinfrastructure include: a solar powered remote monitoring station that sends 1-min recordings every 10 min to a base station, which relays the recordings in real-time to the project server, where the recordings are processed and uploaded to the project website (arbimon.net). Along with a module for viewing, listening, and annotating recordings, the website includes a species identification interface to help users create machine learning algorithms to automate species identification. To demonstrate the system we present data on the vocal activity patterns of birds, frogs, insects, and mammals from Puerto Rico and Costa Rica.},

abstract = {Acoustic ecology, or ecoacoustics, is a growing field that uses sound as a tool to evaluate animal communities. In this manuscript, we evaluate recordings from eight tropical forest sites that vary in species richness, from a relatively low diversity Caribbean forest to a megadiverse Amazonian forest, with the goal of understanding the relationship between acoustic space use (ASU) and species diversity across different taxonomic groups. For each site, we determined the acoustic morphospecies richness and composition of the biophony, and we used a global biodiversity dataset to estimate the regional richness of birds. Here, we demonstrate how detailed information on activity patterns of the acoustic community ({\textless}22 kHz) can easily be visualized and ASU determined by aggregating recordings collected over relatively short periods (4–13 days). We show a strong positive relationship between ASU and regional and acoustic morphospecies richness. Premontane forest sites had the highest ASU and the highest species richness, while dry forest and montane sites had lower ASU and lower species richness. Furthermore, we show that insect richness was the best predictor of variation in total ASU, and that insect richness was proportionally greater at high-diversity sites. In addition, insects used a broad range of frequencies, including high frequencies ({\textgreater}8000 Hz), which contributed to greater ASU. This novel approach for analyzing the presence and acoustic activity of multiple taxonomic groups contributes to our understanding of ecological community dynamics and provides a useful tool for monitoring species in the context of restoration ecology, climate change and conservation biology.},

abstract = {Transmission of random noise through dense corn, a dense hemlock plantation, an open pine stand, dense hardwood brush, and over cultivated soil was measured. The relation between attenuation and frequency in these diverse cases suggested models that permit the prediction of attenuation in any configuration of vegetation and soil. The corn crop had an excess attenuation of 6 dB/100 ft for each doubling of frequency between 500 and 4000 Hz. On the other hand, the stems of the hemlock, pine, and brush all reduced noise by only about 5 dB/100 ft at 4000 Hz. Bare ground attenuates frequencies of 200–1000 Hz, and the frequency of maximum attenuation depends on the soil permeability to air. Thus, tilling the soil reduced the frequency of peak attenuation from 700 to 350 Hz and increased maximum attenuation at 52 m from the source by nearly 80{\%}. Furthermore, earlier conflicting reports of noise attenuation by vegetation appear reconciled if ground attenuation is taken into account. Scattering and ground attenuation are the principal factors in sound attenuation by vegetation. Both factors attenuate relatively less sound as distance from the sound source increases. Hence measurements far from the source can underestimate the effect of a narrow band of vegetation or soil.},

Enormous progress in audio signal processing and pattern recognition in recent years makes it possible to incorporate automated methods into the detection of bird vocalisations. These methods can be employed to support the census of population sizes. We report about a study testing the feasibility of bird monitoring supported by automatic bird song detection. In particular, we describe novel algorithms for the detection of the vocalisations of two endangered bird species and show how these can be used in automatic habitat mapping. These methods are based on detecting temporal patterns in a given frequency band typical for the species. Special effort is put into the suppression of the noise present in real-world audio scenes. Our results show that even in real-world recording conditions high recognition rates with a tolerable rate of false positive detections are possible. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Animals produce sounds for diverse biological functions such as defending territories, attracting mates, deterring predators, navigation, finding food and maintaining contact with members of their social group. Biologists can take advantage of these acoustic behaviours to gain valuable insights into the spatial and temporal scales over which individuals and populations interact. Advances in bioacoustic technology, including the development of autonomous cabled and wireless recording arrays, permit data collection at multiple locations over time. These systems are transforming the way we study individuals and populations of animals and are leading to significant advances in our understandings of the complex interactions between animals and their habitats. 2.

Comparing biophysically equivalent sites, stands dominated by native Metrosideros polymorpha trees hosted larger native avian communities than did mixed stands of Metrosideros and the invasive tree Morella faya. A multi-trophic analysis strongly suggests that native avifauna provide biotic resistance against the invasion of Morella trees and exotic birds, thus slowing invasion "meltdowns" that disrupt the functioning of native Hawaiian ecosystems.},

Similarly to ambient light conditions, which have been shown to play a significant role in ecological speciation, we investigated the existence of ambient sound heteroge-neity and its possible relation to habitat structure and specifically to habitat types (as syntaxonomically defined ecological units). Considering that the struc-ture and composition of animal communities are habitat type specific and that acoustic signals produced by animals may be shaped by the habitat's vegetation structure, natural soundscapes are likely to be habitat specific. We recorded ambient sound in four forest and two grassland habitat types in Northern Greece. Using digital signal techniques and machine learning algo-rithms (self organizing maps, random forests), we concluded that ambient sound is not only spatially heterogeneous, but is also directly related to habitat type structure, pointing towards the existence of habitat type specific acoustic signatures. We provide evidence of the importance of soundscape heteroge-neity and ambient sound signatures and a possible solution to the social cues versus vegetation charac-teristics debate in habitat selection theory.},

abstract = {There is a great need for increased use and further development Of automated sound recording and analysis of avian sounds. Birds are critical to ecosystem functioning so techniques to make avian monitoring more efficient and accurate will greatly benefit science and conservation efforts. We provide an overview of the hardware approaches to automated Sound recording as well as an overview of the prominent techniques used in software to automatically detect and classify avian Sound. We provide a comparative Summary of examples of three general categories of hardware solutions for automating sound recording which include a hardware interface for a scheduling timer to control a standalone commercial recorder, a programmable recording device, and a single board computer. We also describe examples of the two main approaches to improving microphone performance for automated recorders through small arrays of microphone elements and using waveguides. For the purposes of thinking about automated sound analysis, we suggest five basic sound fragment types of avian sound and discuss a variety of techniques to automatically detect and classify avian Sounds to species level, as Wed as their limitations. A variety of the features to measure for the various call types are provided, along with a variety of classification methods for those features. They are discussed in context of general performance as well as the monitoring and conservation efforts they are used in.},

abstract = {Active space 1, that distance from the source over which signal amplitude remains above the detection threshold of potential receivers, was de- termined for Red-winged Blackbird (AgeIaius phoeni- ceus) song in an upland pasture near Ithaca, New York. Song amplitude, the rate of signal attenuation, the amplitude of ambient noise, and the sensitivity of redwings to song masked by noise determine active space and were measured in the field: 1. Maximum root-mean-square song amplitude at 1 m from a singing bird ranged from 88.5-93.5 dB SPL (J{\~{}}{\_}+ SE=90.8 +0.21 dB SPL). 2. Close to the source, song attenuates at a rate which closely matches that predicted by spherical spreading (6 dB/doubling of distance) alone. At dis- tances beyond about 30 m, however, excess attenua- tion becomes important (Fig. 4). The rate of attenua- tion varies with relative wind direction (Table 1). 3. Ambient noise level is relatively low in early morning, rises in late morning and afternoon as air turbulence increases, and then drops again in the evening as turbulence decreases (Table 2 and Ap- pendix). Measured on a 4 kHz octave filter scale (center frequency = 4 kHz, octave pass-band = 2.83- 5.66 kHz), noise during one day ranges from 15 dB SPL (at 06:00 h) to 36 dB SPL (at 11:00 h), more than a 10-fold variation in ambient sound pressure. 4. A 3 dB signal to noise ratio is sufficient for detection of song masked by noise in the field (Figs. 5 and 6). Also, redwings are able to detect differences in this ratio as small as 3 dB. 5. In the absence of wind, the maximum active space of redwing song is about 189 m for a signal SPL of 93.5 dB at 1 m. This distance varies with changes in ambient noise level during the day, and with relative wind direction. Maximum measurements of active space corre- spond closely to the maximum distances across 2 indi- vidual upland redwing territories. This suggests that redwing song is adapted in its structure and amplitude at the source to communicate a male's presence throughout the extent of his neighbors' territories.},

abstract = {Recent awareness of amphibian declines has raised the need for effective monitoring programs. Call surveys are a standard approach to monitoring populations of most anuran species. Temporal variation in calling activity, however, may result in failure to detect some species. Automated recording systems (ARS) allow consistent sampling for extended periods with little or no disturbance to calling anurans. We used an ARS to measure temporal variation in anuran calling activity during the summer of 1997 at a Carolina bay on the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site, South Carolina. We documented considerable interspecific variation in calling activity, a phenomenon that, using traditional call survey techniques, would result in failure to detect some species. In particularw, e found that SouthernL eopard Frogs (Ranas phenocephalat)h, ought to breed only in early spring and fall in the region, called consistently from midnight until dawn during July. Because protocols for most call surveys dictate that the listener survey only during early evening hours, most call surveys would not detect the presence of this species. Our results indicate that temporal variation in anuran calling activity warrants further investigation and should be considered when developing anuran monitoring programs},

AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a ‚{\"{A}}{\'{u}}savvy‚{\"{A}}{\`{u}} prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective.

abstract = {1.Conservation of threatened species relies on predictions about their spatial distribution; however, it is often difficult to detect species in the wild. The combination of acoustic monitoring to improve species detectability and statistical methods to account for false negative detections can improve species distribution estimates. 2.Here, we combine a novel automated species-specific identification approach with occupancy models that account for imperfect detectability to provide a more accurate species distribution map of the Elfin-woods warbler Setophaga angelae, a rare, elusive, and threatened bird species. We also compared three automated species identification/validation approaches to determine which approach provided occupancy estimates similar to manual validation of all recordings. Acoustic data were collected along three elevational gradients (95 to 1074 m a.s.l) in El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico. The detection matrices acquired through automated species-specific identification models and manual validations of all recordings were used to create occupancy models. 3.Although this species has a wider distribution than previously reported, it depends on Palo Colorado forest cover and it mainly occurs between 600 and 900 m a.s.l. Unbiased and precise occupancy models were developed by using automated species identification models and only manually validating 4{\%} of the recordings. 4.Our approach draws on the strength of two active areas of ecological research: acoustic monitoring and occupancy modeling. Our methods provide an effective and efficient way to translate the enormous amount of acoustic information collected with passive acoustic monitoring devices into meaningful ecological data that can be applied to understand and map the distribution of rare, elusive and threatened species.

abstract = {With accelerated land-use change throughout the tropics, an increasing proportion of global biodiversity is located in human-modified landscapes. Understanding the relative effects of landscape composition and configuration on biodiversity is needed to design effective conservation strategies. Yet this topic is poorly understood because most studies have been performed at the patch scale, and do not assess the impact of landscape structure on species. Using a multi-model inference approach, we assessed the relative effect of landscape composition (i.e. percentage of forest cover and matrix composition) and landscape configuration (i.e. number of forest patches and forest edge density) on ??- and ??-diversity of birds in 17 forest fragments and three areas of continuous forest within the Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. We tested these impacts at two spatial scales (100 and 500. ha) for forest specialist and generalist birds. In general, forest specialist birds showed stronger responses to landscape characteristics than generalist species, particularly to variations in landscape composition at the 100-ha scale. The loss of forest cover represented the main threat to forest specialist birds, with a negative impact on ??-diversity that was consistent across the two spatial scales. In contrast, at the two spatial scales generalist birds seemed to be favored by forest loss, as ??-diversity of these birds increased in landscapes with lower forest cover and higher number of forest patches. If current deforestation rates continue, several forest specialists are likely to disappear. Future conservation and management initiatives should therefore prevent deforestation in this biodiversity-rich but vanishing tropical forest ecosystem.},

abstract = {Point counts are the most frequently used technique for sampling bird populations and communities, but have well-known limitations such as inter- and intraobserver errors and limited availability of expert field observers. The use of acoustic recordings to survey birds offers solutions to these limitations. We designed a Soundscape Recording System (SRS) that combines a four-channel, discrete microphone system with a quadraphonic playback system for surveying bird communities. We compared the effectiveness of SRS and point counts for estimating species abundance, richness, and composition of riparian breeding birds in California by comparing data collected simultaneously using both methods. We used the temporal-removal method to estimate individual bird detection probabilities and species abundances using the program MARK. Akaike's Information Criterion provided strong evidence that detection probabilities differed between the two survey methods and among the 10 most common species. The probability of detecting birds was higher when listening to SRS recordings in the laboratory than during the field survey. Additionally, SRS data demonstrated a better fit to the temporal-removal model assumptions and yielded more reliable estimates of detection probability and abundance than point-count data. Our results demonstrate how the perceptual constraints of observers can affect temporal detection patterns during point counts and thus influence abundance estimates derived from time-of-detection approaches. We used a closed-population capture2013recapture approach to calculate jackknife estimates of species richness and average species detection probabilities for SRS and point counts using the program CAPTURE. SRS and point counts had similar species richness and detection probabilities. However, the methods differed in the composition of species detected based on Jaccard's similarity index. Most individuals (83{\%}) detected during point counts vocalized at least once during the survey period and were available for detection using a purely acoustic technique, such as SRS. SRS provides an effective method for surveying bird communities, particularly when most species are detected by sound. SRS can eliminate or minimize observer biases, produce permanent records of surveys, and resolve problems associated with the limited availability of expert field observers. Los conteos por punto son la t�cnica m�s utilizada para muestrear poblaciones y comunidades de aves, pero tienen limitaciones tales como los errores intra- e inter-observador y la escasa disponibilidad de observadores expertos. Una soluci�n a estas limitaciones es el uso de grabaciones en el campo para censar aves. Dise�amos un sistema de grabaci�n de paisajes sonoros, SRS (por sus siglas en ingl�s), que combina un sistema de grabaci�n de cuatro canales discretos con un sistema de reproducci�n cuadraf�nica para el censado de comunidades de aves. Comparamos la efectividad del SRS y la de los conteos por punto para estimar la abundancia, riqueza y composici�n de comunidades de aves en h�bitats riparios en California, comparando los datos colectados simult�neamente con ambas t�cnicas. Utilizamos el m�todo de remoci�n-temporal para estimar la probabilidad de detecci�n de individuos y abundancia de especies utilizando el programa MARK. El Criterio de Informaci�n Akaike provey� evidencia sustancial de que existen diferencias en la probabilidad de detecci�n entre ambos m�todos y entre las 10 especies m�s comunes de aves. La probabilidad de detecci�n de aves result� mayor cuando se escucharon las grabaciones del SRS en el laboratorio que durante los conteos por punto en el campo. Adem�s, los datos tomados con la t�cnica SRS demostraron estar mejor adaptados a los supuestos del modelo de remoci�n-temporal y ofrecieron estimados m�s confiables de abundancia y de probabilidad de detecci�n que los datos de conteos por puntos. Nuestros resultados demuestran c�mo la percepci�n de los observadores puede afectar los patrones de detecci�n temporal durante los conteos por punto, influyendo en las estimaciones de abundancia derivadas de procedimientos de tiempo de detecci�n. Utilizamos el m�todo de captura-recaptura de poblaci�n cerrada para calcular las estimaciones de jackknife de riqueza de especies y la probabilidad de detecci�n de especies para SRS y conteos por punto, utilizando el programa CAPTURE. Ambos tuvieron �ndices de riqueza de especies y probabilidades de detecci�n similares. Sin embargo, los m�todos difirieron en la composici�n de especies detectadas basados en el �ndice de similitud de Jaccard. La mayor�a de los individuos detectados durante los conteos por punto (83{\%}) vocalizaron al menos una vez durante el periodo de censado, y estuvieron disponibles para ser detectados utilizando una t�cnica ac�stica, como SRS. La t�cnica SRS provee un m�todo efectivo para censar comunidades de aves, particularmente cuando la mayor�a de las especies son detectadas por sus sonidos. El SRS puede eliminar o minimizar los sesgos del observador, producir registros permanentes de los censos, y resolver problemas asociados a la limitada disponibilidad de expertos en el campo.},

abstract = {Although acoustic recordings have recently gained popularity as an alternative to point counts for surveying birds, little is known about the relative performance of the two methods for detecting tropical bird species across multiple vegetation types. During June and July 2008, we collected species detection/nondetection data to compare the performance of a quadraphonic acoustic recording system and point counts for estimating species richness and composition and detection probabilities of 15 rare, moderately common, and common tropical bird species across six structurally distinct vegetation types (coastal dune scrub, mangrove, low-stature deciduous thorn forest, early and late successional medium-stature semievergreen forest, and grazed pastures) in the northern Yucatan Peninsula.We selected five rare species endemic to the Yucatan Peninsula and 10 moderately common and common species that also occur in other tropical regions. Species richness and composition did not differ between survey methods in any of the vegetation types. At the population level, however, we found support for an effect of method on detection probability for most species. For 13 species, regardless of their abundance, acoustic recordings yielded detection probabilities as high as or higher than those for point counts across all vegetation types. The remaining two species were better detected by point counts in pastures and coastal scrub, where greater visibility likely improved sightings of these species. However, these species were detected as well as or better by acoustic recordings in forests and mangroves where detections were primarily auditory. In tropical regions where experienced field observersmay not be available and funding for field surveys may be limited, acoustic recordings offer a practical solution for determining species richness and composition and the occupancy patterns of most species. However, for some species, a combination of methods will provide the most reliable data. Regardless of the method selected, analyses that account for variation in detection probability among vegetation types will be necessary because most species in our study demonstrated vegetation-dependent detection probabilities},

abstract = {The golden jackal (Canis aureus) utters complex howls that can be used to monitor their population density and distribution in a specific area. However, little is known of the vocal behaviour of this species. In the present paper, we show the first results of the acoustic analysis that followed the acoustic monitoring of the golden jackal in Friuli–Venezia Giulia during 2011–2013. We estimated the number of callers by screening the fundamental frequency of the emissions within a howl. We analysed 42 vocalizations given by a single jackal or multiple individuals. The howling duration significantly increased with the number of emitters, which ranged between one and three in our estimates. Twenty-nine howls were then submitted to a quantitative semi-automatic analysis procedure based on dynamic time warping. Based on the resulting dissimilarity indices, vocal emissions were clustered in six different acoustically uniform groups, which showed a potential for these procedures to be developed into future monitoring tools. The results suggest the need for integration between jackal howling, bioacoustics and camera trapping. Introduction},

abstract = {Audio event recognition methods based on the Hidden Markov Model / Gaussian Mixture Model (HMM/GMM) often depend on a large number of mixture components or multi-stage models that require significant computational and memory resources during their operation. A widely used approach for coping with complexity is employing an acoustic activity detector, which selects for further processing only those portions of the audio that are considered promising. As a result, the audio feature extraction and the subsequent pattern recognition stages will process only a subset of the original audio stream, helping to reduce the misclassification rates while lowering the computational demands. In the present work we propose a method for bird acoustic activity detection, based on morphological filtering of the spectrogram seen as an image. The practical significance of the proposed method is validated on the automated acoustic recognition of Southern Lapwing Vanellus chilensis, a common Neotropical bird species. Compared with other methods of acoustic activity detection it demonstrates advantageous performance.},

abstract = {Biodiversity assessment is one of the major challenges for ecology and conservation. With current increase of biodiversity loss during the last decades, there is an urgent need to quickly estimate biodiversity levels. This study aims at testing the validity of new biodiversity indices based on an acoustic analysis of choruses produced by animal communities. The new Acoustic Richness index (AR) and the former dissimilarity index (D) aim at assessing $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity respectively. Both indices were tested in three woodland habitats: a mature forest, a young forest and a forest-cropland ecotone within the Parc Naturel R{\'{e}}gional of Haute-Vall{\'{e}}e de Chevreuse (France). Three recorders running for 74 days generated 5328 files of 150 s for a total of 222 h of recording. All files were treated with frequency and amplitude filters to try to remove anthropogenic and environmental background noise. The AR index was in agreement with traditional aural identification of bird species. The AR index revealed an expected gradient of diversity with higher diversity values in the young forest that potentially provides a higher number of microhabitats. The D index also indicated expected differences in the acoustic environment across sites with distinct habitat structure. Both indices reveal significant peak during dawn chorus. These results suggest that diversity could be estimated through acoustics at both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ scales. Our analyses reveal that, even if background noise needs to be considered with great care, the use of acoustic indices has the potential to facilitate animal diversity assessments over seasons or years and landscape scales. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The past decade has produced an increased ecological interest in sonic environments, or soundscapes. However, despite this rise in interest and technological improvements that allow for long-term acoustic surveys in various environments, some habitats' soundscapes remain to be explored. Ponds, and more generally freshwater habitats, are one of these acoustically unexplored environments. Here we undertook the first long term acoustic monitoring of three temperate ponds in France. By aural and visual inspection of a selection of recordings, we identified 48 different sound types, and according to the rarefaction curves we calculated, more sound types are likely present in one of the three ponds. The richness of sound types varied significantly across ponds. Surprisingly, there was no pond-to-pond daily consistency of sound type richness variation; each pond had its own daily patterns of activity. We also explored the possibility of using six acoustic diversity indices to conduct rapid biodiversity assessments in temperate ponds. We found that all indices were sensitive to the background noise as estimated through correlations with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, we determined that the AR index could be a good candidate to measure acoustic diversities using partial correlations with the SNR as a control variable. Yet, research is still required to automatically compute the SNR in order to apply this index on a large data set of recordings. The results showed that these three temperate ponds host a high level of acoustic diversity in which the soundscapes were variable not only between but also within the ponds. The sources producing this diversity of sounds and the drivers of difference in daily song type richness variation both require further investigation. Such research would yield insights into the biodiversity and ecology of temperate ponds.},

Of the twenty species, ten belonged to the superfamily Grylloidea, nine to the superfamily Tettigonioidea and one to the superfamily Gryllacridoidea. The calls of the gryllid species were narrow-band with dominant frequencies ranging from 3 – 7 kiloHertz. The calls of the tettigoniids covered a wide spectral range, reaching far into the ultrasound in some species. Four of the nine tettigoniid species had narrow-band, relatively low frequency calls centred at 3, 9, 11 and 15 kiloHertz respectively. The temporal patterns of the species were diverse, with syllable durations ranging from eight to 63 milliseconds and syllable periods from 17 milliseconds to two seconds. The calls of the species showed considerable overlap in both spectral and temporal features. Calling activity peaked between six o'clock in the evening and midnight and died down subsequently. We found no diel partitioning of calling time between acoustically communicating ensiferan species. Species accumulation curves suggest that the acoustic community has been almost completely sampled.},

There were significant differences in mean calling heights between species. Calling heights of different gryllid and tettigoniid species ranged from the ground to the canopy. More gryllid than tettigoniid species occupied the ground and herb layer. Our study revealed vertical stratification of calling heights, with discrete layers corresponding to the canopy, understorey and the ground layer. These clusters emerged from the raw data of calling heights of individuals without a priori distinction of layers.

The values and benefits of soundscapes are motivation to advance soundscape conservation and management. Given that soundscape conservation is new, we present a summary of conservation principles that need to be considered in soundscape conservation planning. These include the need to set goals, identify targets, assess condition, identify and manage threats, and conduct monitoring of the soundscape. We also argue that soundscape conservation needs to consider the soundscape within the larger mosaic of the landscape that is occupied by humans—a perspective provided by landscape ecology. We describe several different kinds of soundscapes that need to be conserved, such as natural quiet, sensitive, threatened, and unique soundscapes, and the ways that conservation planning can protect these for the future.},

abstract = {Faced with rapid and extensive conversion of tropical rain forests to a landscape consisting of pasture lands, and with the need to preserve the avian diversity of tropical regions, it is imperative to determine how different species have responded to anthropogenic alterations of their natural habitats. We sampled birds in undisturbed and disturbed forest islands in regenerating forests and in four replicates of each of the following man-made habitats: arboreal agricultural habitats (cacao, coffee, mixed, citrus and allspice), non-arboreal agricultural habitats (corn, jalapeno chili pepper and bananas), live fences and pastures, at Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. We censused 22145 birds representing 226 species. We detected 79{\%} of the species in forest habitats, 80{\%} in agricultural habitats, 43{\%} in live fences and only 5{\%} in pastures. Isolating distance and continued disturbance by humans of forest fragments were important variables influencing species' richness. Arboreal agricultural habitats and live fences were richer in species and in birds than non-arboreal man-made habitats. Economic surveys showed that some of the crops investigated yield higher returns than cattle ranching based on pastures. We discuss the conservation value for birds of agricultural islands and of live fences as landscape elements that help reduce physical and biotic isolation among remaining configurations of forest fragments in Los Tuxtlas.},

abstract = {Lowcost (audio) recorders (LCRs) represent a new opportunity to investigate the sonic complexity of both natural and urban ecosystems. LCRs are inexpensive sampling audio recorders which have the external shape of a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive, and are composed of amicrophone, an analog-to-digital converter, central processing unitwith permanent internal non-volatile memory, rechargeable battery, and a USB connection. The reduced dimen- sions allow the device to be deployed inconspicuously within any environment, in any config- uration and for an extended time period. This investigation tested a specific type of LCR (UR-09) with a spectral range of 8 kHz - sufficient to cover the acoustic range of most western Palearctic songbirds. The reliability of the UR-09, compared with other commercial recorders (Zoom H4 and Song Meter SM1) and based on the quality of recordings quantified by the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), was tested and confirmed. An example of the application of LCRs is presentedinanevaluationofthe audiopatterns occurring during dawn and dusk choruses within a forested ecosystem. Results of this investigation are encouraging and a new generation of LCR devices is currently being designed with real-time acoustic data processing capabilities, timer programmability, a larger frequency range and wireless communication compatibility. LCRs are revealed to be ideal instruments to conduct surveys in fragile or protected areas and also in urban environments. Moreover, due to their low cost, they can be used to encourage research in soundscape ecology, especially within developing countries, where large areas can be monitored by professionals or incorporating citizen science models of data collection},

abstract = {The soundscape is proposed as a phenomenological entity with which to investigate environmental complexity. In particular, the avian soundtope, which is defined as a place in which sound is intentionally structured by different bird species, is regarded as an agency acting to achieve several goals. In fact, the soundtope could be viewed as a special case of an eco-field used by birds, not only to establish territorial ownership and patrol an area but also as a means of locating and evaluating the availability of many other material and immaterial resources. The meaning of the multifaceted acoustic pattern produced by bird communities during the breeding season is discussed here under the acoustic niche hypothesis in terms of community coalescence and the permanent establishment of an inter-specific communication network. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal dimensions of a bird soundscape have also been analyzed and discussed in terms of their relationship with environmental proxies. A new Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), coupled with the implementation (ACI plug-in) of a specific sound editor (WaveSurfer), is proposed as a way of processing sound data efficiently, thus providing new opportunities to use the bird soundscape signature for landscape characterization and describing the ecological dynamics of long-term monitoring schemes.},

abstract = {Herein we present one of the first attempts to couple the complexity of vegetation and topographic features with the sonic environment to understand the distribution of bird species and individuals in their habitat. To achieve this, the sonic features of a bird community were studied during the spring and early summer of 2011 in a Mediterranean maqui located on the western slope of a remote hanging valley that is dominated by Erica arborea, Quercus ilex and Arbutus unedo. Species composition, height, vertical foliage profile, canopy density and dispersion of vegetation were utilized as probable proxies for the sonic patterns. The acoustic activity of birds was collected through the use of a regular matrix of 20 audio recorders, spaced 25. m apart, which were placed following the topographic isoclines. The sonic complexity of the soundscape was evaluated using the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), which is a recently developed metric. The PCA applied to the vegetation parameters revealed two principal distinguishing factors, which we were able to define as "vegetation density and structure" and "species segregation." Moreover, the results show that, even in the case of sampling sites that are very close together, sonic patterns vary across the season, highlighting the great variability of the soundscape and confirming the adequacy of the sampling scale of 25. m adopted in this study. The topographic features do not seem to be connected to the sonic environment. The main sonic complexity was found where the vegetation was taller and denser, especially where E. arborea was the dominant species. Although this proves that acoustic dynamics can be linked to vegetation structure, even on a small scale, a consistent element of sonic variability cannot be explained by vegetation patterns alone, and a soundtope hypothesis must be invoked. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The soundscape represents the acoustic footprint of a landscape, and may well be a source of a vast amount of information that could be used efficiently in, for example, long-term bird aggregation monitoring schemes. To depict such soundscape footprint, specific indexes are requested. In particular, the aim of this paper was to extensively describe the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) and to successively apply it to process the sound files recorded in an ecologically fragile area in a Mediterranean maqui (Eastern Liguria, Italy). Daily acoustic animal activity was sampled in 90 one-minute files between the end of May and the end of July, 2010, using a pre-programmed recording procedure (Songmeter, Wildlife Acoustic). The WaveSurfer software, powered by the Soundscape Metric plug-in, was then utilized to quickly process these data.This approach allows the identification of the compositional changes and acoustic fluctuations activity of a local community (in the proposed case prevalently composed by birds and cicadas). In particular, two distinct patterns emerged during the investigation. From 20 May to 4 July, the soundscape was dominated by birds but, after that period, the onset of the cicadas' songs completely changed the sound dynamics. The proposed methodology has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to identify the complex patterns of the soundscape across different temporal scales (hours, days and intraseason). This approach could also be adopted in long-term studies to monitor animal dynamics under different environmental scenarios. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ecoacoustic events are functional units of the acoustic environment. Their classification offers a substantial contribution to interpreting ecological complexity. A procedure for their detection and identification, Ecoacoustic Event Detection and Identification (EEDI), is proposed and discussed. Dedicated software (SoundscapeMeter 2.0) is illustrated in a detailed manual. EEDI operates according to two steps: in a first step, a numerical analysis based on the ACI metrics, ACIft and its evenness ACIfte, detects potential events inside an event space. In a second step, the detected events are identified using the acoustic signature (ACItf) of events previously empirically identified. The EEDI procedure can be extensively used in basic and applied research. In particular, EEDI can be used in long-term monitoring programs to assess the effect of climate change on the dynamics of individual species and on the associated acoustic communities. The EEDI model can also be used to investigate the acoustic intrusion of humans in natural systems and in urban areas.},

abstract = {From December 7 through 10, 2007, an international expert meeting on IT-based detection of bioacoustic patterns was held at the facilities of the International Academy for Nature Conservation on the Isle of Vilm in the Baltic Sea. The meeting was held under the patronage of the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (Bundesamt fur Naturschutz, BfN) in the context of a research project on bioacoustic pattern recognition. The progress in information technology during the last years, especially in the field of pattern recognition, opens up important new perspectives for the automated bioacoustic monitoring of a multitude of animal species. The idea of the meeting was to bring together specialists from all over the world, to discuss the potential of IT-based detection of bioacoustic patterns. The topics of the meeting covered both the current knowledge on acoustic pattern recognition in bioacoustic signals and the application of bioacoustic methods for purposes of the monitoring of wild animals. This publication contains expanded versions of the talks given during the meeting, giving an impression of the problems and methods in the field of algorithmic bioacoustics from scientists from Australia, the USA, Italy, Spain, Finland, Switzerland, the UK, the Netherlands and Germany. The articles cover a wide variety of animal species from insects and frogs to birds, from whales to bats. Monitoring locations reach from the densely populated centre of Europe to the out-backs of Australia, from the Mediterranean Sea to Antarctica.},

abstract = {Bioacoustic monitoring is becoming more and more popular as a non-invasive method to study populations and communities of vocalizing animals. Acoustic pattern recognition techniques allow for automated identification of species and an estimation of species composition within ecosystems. Here we describe an approach where on the basis of long term acoustic recordings not only the occurrence of a species was documented, but where the number of vocalizing animals was also estimated. This approach allows us to follow up changes in population density and to define breeding sites in a changing environment. We present the results of five years of continuous acoustic monitoring of Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris) in a recent wetland restoration area. Using a setup consisting of four four-channel recorders equipped with cardioid microphones we recorded vocal activity during entire nights. Vocalizations of bitterns were detected on the recordings by spectrogram template matching. On basis of time differences of arrival (TDOA) of the acoustic signals at different recording devices booming bitterns could be mapped using hyperbolic localization. During the study period not only changes in the number of calling birds but also changes in their spatial distribution connected with changes in habitat structure could be documented. This semi-automated approach towards monitoring birds described here could be applied to a wide range of monitoring tasks for animals with long distance vocalizations. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soundscape assessment has been proposed as a remote ecological monitoring tool for measuring biodiversity, but few studies have examined how soundscape patterns vary with landscape configuration and condition. The goal of our study was to examine a suite of published acoustic indices to determine whether they provide comparable results relative to varying levels of landscape fragmentation and ecological condition in nineteen forest sites in eastern Australia. Our comparison of six acoustic indices according to time of day revealed that two indices, the acoustic complexity and the bioacoustic index, presented a similar pattern that was linked to avian song intensity, but was not related to landscape and biodiversity attributes. The diversity indices, acoustic entropy and acoustic diversity, and the normalized difference soundscape index revealed high nighttime sound, as well as a dawn and dusk chorus. These indices appear to be sensitive to nocturnal biodiversity which is abundant at night in warm, subtropical environments. We argue that there is need to better understand temporal partitioning of the soundscape by specific taxonomic groups, and this should involve integrated research on amphibians, insects and birds during a 24h cycle. The three indices that best connected the soundscape with landscape characteristics, ecological condition and bird species richness were acoustic entropy, acoustic evenness and the normalized difference soundscape index. This study has demonstrated that remote soundscape assessment can be implemented as an ecological monitoring tool in fragmented Australian forest landscapes. However, further investigation should be dedicated to refining and/or combining existing acoustic indices and also to determine if these indices are appropriate in other landscapes and for other survey purposes.},

@article{Gage2013,
abstract = {Soundscape Ecology is an emerging area of science that does not focus on the identification of species in the soundscape but attempts to characterize sounds by organizing them into those produced by biological organisms such as birds, amphibians, insects or mammals; physical environmental factors such as thunder, rainfall or wind; and sounds produced by human entities such as airplanes, automobiles or air conditioners. The soundscape changes throughout the day and throughout the seasons. The soundscape components that create the sound occur at different frequencies. A set of metrics termed soundscape power was computed and visualized to examine the patterns of daily and seasonal change in the soundscape. Automated recorders were used to record soundscape samples every half hour for one minute duration from six sites on an uninhabited island in Twin Lakes located near Cheboygan in Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula. Each recording was divided into 1 kHz frequency intervals and visualization tools were used to examine the soundscape power in each interval during 48 half-hour time segments from April-October for four consecutive years. Daily patterns of soundscape power change were also examined during the seven month sample period. To synthesize the data set, three dimensional contour plots were used to visualize day of the year (x), time of day (y) and soundscape power (z) for several frequency intervals. A further synthesis was developed to visualize soundscape change using a Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) which is a ratio of low to high frequencies. The visualization of the soundscape revealed discrete patterns in the soundscape including striking changes in the time of the occurrence of dawn and dusk choruses. The patterns in the soundscape were remarkably similar over the four-year investigation. Soundscape power in the lower frequency examined (1-2 kHz) was a dominant feature of the soundscape at Twin Lakes and the low frequency soundscape power was negatively correlated with higher frequency sounds. The soundscape power metrics and the visualizations of the soundscape produced in this study should provide a means of rapidly synthesizing large numbers of recordings into meaningful patterns to examine soundscape change. This is especially useful because of the need to develop indices of ecological metrics based on soundscape attributes to assist resource managers in making decisions about ecosystem integrity. Visualization can also be of immense benefit to examine patterns in large soundscape time series data sets that can be produced by automated recording devices. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Drastic biodiversity declines have raised concerns about the deterioration of ecosystem functions and have motivated much recent research on the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. A functional trait framework has been proposed to improve the mechanistic understanding of this relationship, but this has rarely been tested for organisms other than plants. We analysed eight datasets, including five animal groups, to examine how well a trait-based approach, compared with a more traditional taxonomic approach, predicts seven ecosystem functions below- and above-ground. Trait-based indices consistently provided greater explanatory power than species richness or abundance. The frequency distributions of single or multiple traits in the community were the best predictors of ecosystem functioning. This implies that the ecosystem functions we investigated were underpinned by the combination of trait identities (i.e. single-trait indices) and trait complementarity (i.e. multi-trait indices) in the communities. Our study provides new insights into the general mechanisms that link biodiversity to ecosystem functioning in natural animal communities and suggests that the observed responses were due to the identity and dominance patterns of the trait composition rather than the number or abundance of species per se.},

abstract = {Traditional human-observer-based biological surveys are expensive. Therefore most biodiversity studies are implemented only periodically, for short periods, and predominantly during daytime and under favorable weather conditions. Automated data acquisition and analysis can overcome these shortcomings and facilitate continuous monitoring. Here we report on the development of an automated acoustic recognizer for Southern Lapwing Vanellus chilensis lampronotus vocalizations, a first for this species. The recognizer is a species-specific information retrieval agent, which searches throughout long audio recordings in order to detect and timestamp call events of the target species. The recognizer relies on a log-likelihood ratio estimator, based on a Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM), complemented with purposely-developed temporal post-processing that incorporates domain knowledge about the structure of V. chilensis vocalizations. Validation experiments with real-field recordings of complex soundscapes indicate that the recognizer is sensitive enough to register V. chilensis call events with sound levels down to -30 dB and recognition accuracy of up to 85.6{\%}, at zero false positive rates. The recognizer is considered a valuable tool for computer-assisted analysis of hourly and daily acoustic activity of V. chilensis over extended periods of time, as it offers an indispensable support to long-term monitoring studies and conservation efforts in the Pantanal region.1},

abstract = {Rapid acoustic surveys aim to estimate biodiversity based on the diversity of sounds produced by animal communities, and interest in this approach among conservation planners is increasing. Several indices of acoustic diversity have been proposed as proxies for species richness. However, in the field, the animal activity may be responsible for acoustic diversity to varying degrees. To evaluate how measures of acoustic diversity may depart from actual species richness, we selected seven acoustic indices and applied them to simulated recordings of bird assemblages under different field conditions. For a given sound, defined here as the song composition emitted by a species assemblage, we determined if the indices were i) only driven by animal sounds, ii) insensitive to species identity, and iii) independent of species evenness. Under the field conditions evaluated, none of the indices fulfilled the three criteria necessary for a perfect proxy of species richness. However, some indices may be appropriate as a measure of biodiversity under a more broad definition including phylogenetic and/or functional aspects of diversity. We provide recommendations for the application of these indices for biodiversity measurement under field conditions, such as the application of appropriate audio filters, the increase of the repetition rate of the recordings, and the identification of the main taxonomic groups occurring in the recorded communities.},

abstract = {Measuring biodiversity is a challenging task for research in taxonomy, ecology and conservation. Biodiversity is commonly measured using metrics related to species richness, phylogenetic-, or functional-trait diversity of species assemblages. Because these metrics are not always correlated with each other, they have to be considered separately. A descriptor of animal diversity based on the diversity of sounds produced by animal communities, named here the Community Acoustic Diversity (CAD), was recently proposed. In many cases, the CAD could be easier to measure than other metrics. Although previous analyses have revealed that acoustic diversity might increase as species richness increases, the ability of CAD to reflect other components of biodiversity has not been formally investigated. The aim of this study is to test theoretically whether functional and phylogenetic diversities could be reflected by acoustic diversity indices in bird communities. Data on species assemblages were collated by the French Breeding Bird Survey describing spatial and temporal variation in community structure and composition across France since 2001. Phylogenetic and functional data were compiled from literature. Acoustic data were obtained from sound libraries. For each of the 19,420 sites sampled, indices of phylogenetic, functional and acoustic diversity of bird communities were calculated based on species' pair-wise distance matrices and species' abundances. The different aspects of biodiversity were compared through correlation analyses. The results showed that acoustic diversity was correlated with phylogenetic diversity, when the branch lengths of the tree were considered, and to functional diversity, especially body mass and reproduction. Correlations between phylogenetic, functional and acoustic distances among species did not entirely explain the correlations between phylogenetic, functional and acoustic diversity within communities. This result was interpreted as an effect of local ecological processes underpinning how bird communities assemble. Comparing the diversity patterns with a null model, phylogenetic and functional diversities were significantly clustered whereas acoustic diversity was not different from what was expected by chance. A comparison between acoustic indices showed that spectral component of acoustic diversity seems more appropriate to reveal bird phylogenetic diversity whereas temporal component seems more adapted to reveal functional diversity of a bird community. Overall, even if the processes at the origin of the different facets of biodiversity are different, CAD reveals part of phylogenetic diversity and some extent of functional diversity. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {New Caledonia is a Pacific island with a unique biodiversity showing an extreme microendemism. Many species distributions observed on this island are extremely restricted, localized to mountains or rivers making biodiversity evaluation and conservation a difficult task. A rapid biodiversity assessment method based on acoustics was recently proposed. This method could help to document the unique spatial structure observed in New Caledonia. Here, this method was applied in an attempt to reveal differences among three mountain sites (Mandj{\'{e}}lia, Koghis and Aoupini{\'{e}}) with similar ecological features and species richness level, but with high beta diversity according to different microendemic assemblages. In each site, several local acoustic communities were sampled with audio recorders. An automatic acoustic sampling was run on these three sites for a period of 82 successive days. Acoustic properties of animal communities were analysed without any species identification. A frequency spectral complexity index (NP) was used as an estimate of the level of acoustic activity and a frequency spectral dissimilarity index (Df ) assessed acoustic differences between pairs of recordings. As expected, the index NP did not reveal significant differences in the acoustic activity level between the three sites. However, the acoustic variability estimated by the index Df , could first be explained by changes in the acoustic communities along the 24-hour cycle and second by acoustic dissimilarities between the three sites. The results support the hypothesis that global acoustic analyses can detect acoustic differences between sites with similar species richness and similar ecological context, but with different species assemblages. This study also demonstrates that global acoustic methods applied at broad spatial and temporal scales could help to assess local biodiversity in the challenging context of microendemism. The method could be deployed over large areas, and could help to compare different sites and determine conservation priorities.},

abstract = {Nocturnal bird assemblages are poorly known in most tropical locations, and information about their presence and behavior is often limited to the results of dawn or dusk surveys.We investigated the use ofmanualand automatic-detection methods to identify nocturnal birds in acoustic recordings made at Soberania National Park, Republic of Panama. Five nocturnal species were detected in dusk recordings, and a sixth species (Great Potoo, Nyctibius grandis) was detected only after dark. Automatic data template detectors (DTD's) were developed and used to detect Crested Owls (Lophostrix cristata), Black-and-White Owls (Ciccaba nigrolineata), Vermiculated Screech-Owls (Megasops guatemalae), and Great Potoos. Manual analysis of 300 h of overnight recordings allowed us to quantify DTD performance. Sensitivity, the proportion of known calls of target species identified by DTDs, ranged from 0.17 for Black-and-White Owls to 0.79 for Vermiculated Screech-Owls. Positive predictive value, the proportion of detected sounds that corresponded to the target species, ranged from 0.39 for Black-and-White Owls to 0.60 for Crested Owls. Our results demonstrate that a combination of manual and automated analysis of audio recordings can provide a verifiable, systematic method to determine the presence of nocturnal birds in tropical forests, investigate temporal activity, and calculate detection probability.},

abstract = {—Ecosystems provide essential services for human society, which include provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Amphibians provide provisioning services by serving as a food source for some human societies, especially in Southeast Asia. They also serve as models in medical research and provide potential for new pharmaceuticals such as analgesics and anti-viral drugs derived from skin secretions. Amphibians contribute to regulating services by reducing mosquito recruitment from ephemeral wetlands, potentially controlling other pest species, and indirectly through predation of insect pollinators. Often neglected, ecosystems also provide cultural services to human societies that increase the quality of human life through recreation, religion, spirituality, and aesthetics. As an abundant and diverse class of vertebrates, amphibians also play prominent roles in the culture of human societies through pathways such as mythology, literature, and art. Most research on the role of amphibians in ecosystems has been on their contribution to supporting services. This is also the area where amphibians are likely to have the largest contribution to ecosystem services. Supporting services have structural (e.g., habitat) and functional (e.g., ecosystem functions and processes) components. Amphibians can affect ecosystem structure through soil burrowing and aquatic bioturbation and ecosystem functions such as decomposition and nutrient cycling through waste excretion and indirectly through predatory changes in the food web. They also can control primary production in aquatic ecosystems through direct consumption and nutrient cycling. Unfortunately, amphibians are experiencing major declines and humans may be losing associated ecosystem services. It is important to understand how declines affect ecosystem services for human societies, but these declines can also serve as natural experiments to understand the role of amphibians in ecosystems.},

abstract = {Urban acoustic environments consist of various sound sources including traffic noise, human-generated sounds, and natural sounds that affect the soundscape perception of a given location. However, these sound sources are indistinguishable by noise maps that are based on sound pressure levels. Hence, soundscape maps based on the perception of sounds are necessary to describe an acoustic environment more accurately. Presented herein is a study of soundscape perception, which employs GIS techniques to generate soundscape maps in various urban settings including commercial, business, recreational, and residential spaces. Soundscape perceptions and physical characteristics of the acoustic environments pertaining to these urban settings were evaluated from questionnaire surveys and acoustic measurements, respectively. The results demonstrate how soundscape perceptions and spatial variation in urban soundscapes are closely related to their corresponding urban contexts},

abstract = {Evidence is mounting that extinctions are altering key processes important to the productivity and sustainability of Earth's eco-systems 1–4 . Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes 5–8 , but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition—two processes important in all ecosystems—are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experi-ments, intermediate levels of species loss (21–40{\%}) reduced plant production by 5–10{\%}, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41–60{\%}) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO 2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on de-composition than did elevated CO 2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in pro-ductivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major inter-national concern and remediation efforts 9 . A variety of global changes are driving rates of species extinction that greatly outpace background rates in the fossil record 10,11 . If these trends continue, projections suggest that within 240 years Earth may face the sixth mass extinction 12 . Such projections have prompted hundreds of experiments examining how different components of biodiversity affect ecosystem processes that sustain the provisioning of goods and services to society. Syntheses of these experiments have made it clear that plant biodiversity loss will reduce plant production and alter decomposition 5,6 . However, it is uncertain how the sizes of these effects compare with the direct effects of other types of envir-onmental change, such as changing atmospheric composition, climate warming and nutrient pollution, that also threaten ecosystem func-tioning 13–15 . This uncertainty has generated wide-ranging speculation about how strongly biodiversity loss might affect humanity 16,17 . Here we report the results of a large data synthesis in which we compared the effects of species loss against other drivers of envir-onmental change. We focus on primary production and decomposi-tion because these major biological processes influence carbon storage and other ecosystem services, and illustrate the breadth of sensitivity of ecosystem processes to changes in species richness 2,6,18},

abstract = {There is growing interest in the potential use of autonomous recording units (ARUs) to obtain point-count bird survey data in the absence of human observers. To determine possible reasons for differences in the point-count performances of humans and ARUs and to better understand the possible limitations of ARUs, we compared the results of point-counts conducted by human observers with those conducted using ARUs. Human observers and ARUs recorded birds at 56 point-count stations in three different habitats (green mixed-conifer forest, burned mixed-conifer forest, and mixed riparian cottonwood bottomland). Combined, human observers and ARUs generated a total of 858 detections of 86 different species. We found that 9.7{\%} of detections were recorded by ARUs only, 40.9{\%} by human observers only, and 49.4{\%} by both ARUs and humans. The mean number of species detections per point was significantly greater for human observers (13.8) than for ARUs (9.1), and did not differ significantly among habitat types. Birds not detected using ARU recordings included those with songs or calls too distant to be recorded (52.7{\%}), those detected by human observers using only visual cues (14.8{\%}), and those too difficult to identify from recordings (10.3{\%}) or simply overlooked (8.8{\%}). About two-thirds (68.7{\%}) of birds detected using ARUs, but missed by human observers in the field, were simply overlooked in the field; most of the rest were the result of misidentification in the lab. The failure of ARUs to record a large proportion of the detections recorded by human observers, combined with problems with detecting or identifying sounds in the lab and the extra time and cost associated with use of ARUs, suggest that they would not provide a cost-effective means of gathering data for traditional point-count surveys. Existe un crecimiento en el inter{\'{e}}s del uso de Unidades de Grabaci{\'{o}}n Aut{\'{o}}nomas (UGA's) para obtener datos de conteo por punto en la ausencia de observadores humanos. Para determinar las posibles razones de las diferencias en el rendimiento de conteos por punto de humanos y de UGA's y para proveer informaci{\'{o}}n sobre las posibles limitaciones de UGA's, comparamos los resultados de conteos por punto realizados por observadores humanos con los resultados de conteos por punto usando UGA's. Los observadores humanos y las UGA's registraron aves en 56 puntos de conteo ubicados en tres h{\'{a}}bitats diferentes (bosque verde de con{\'{i}}feros mixto, bosque quemado de con{\'{i}}feros mixto, y vegetaci{\'{o}}n ribere{\~{n}}o mixto). Los observadores humanos y las UGA's en combinaci{\'{o}}n generaron un total de 858 detecciones de 86 especies diferentes. Encontramos que 9.7{\%} de las detecciones fueron grabados solo por UGA's, 40.9{\%} solo por los observadores y 49.4{\%} por las UGA's y los humanos. El n{\'{u}}mero promedio de especies detectados por punto fue significativamente mayor para los observadores humanos (13.8) que para UGA's (9.1), sin una diferencia significativa entre los tipos de h{\'{a}}bitat. Las aves que no fueron detectadas usando las grabaciones de UGA's incluyeron las con cantos demasiados distantes para ser grabados (52.7{\%}), las que fueron detectadas por observadores humanos mediante la observaci{\'{o}}n visual (14.8{\%}), las que fueron muy dif{\'{i}}ciles para identificar usando las grabaciones (10.3{\%}), o las cuales simplemente no fueron detectadas (8.8{\%}).

Science is critical to understanding the effects of climate change and for analyzing the vulnerability of parks, and is the basis for park management decisions. This look at the science of climate change complements our discussion last spring of adaptation and mitigation strategies for dealing with climate change and the importance of engaging and communicating with the public. Like that issue, this one shares many examples of how park managers are responding to the challenge. I am not surprised that a resource management issue as universal as climate change garnered articles about parks in the Arctic and subtropics and from sea level to the alpine life zone. Though varied, these articles highlight several pertinent themes. For example, a suite of scientific disciplines and methods are needed to investigate and understand climate change and its effects on parks. Vulnerability assessments are important to identify the susceptibility of resources and to prioritize actions. Models are important, but field observations over long time periods are essential. Climate change science is complex and the demand for it so vast that it is best met through collaboration. A corollary is that with so much information pouring in, scientists need to help managers synthesize and assimilate it into park scenarios. For me the overriding theme is that climate change is transforming park management in scope and scale and by presenting very tough questions. For example, research projects designed to understand and enhance species resilience may also help address the uncertainties of when to intervene and to what extent, but these remain difficult management judgments. Also, h0w should we document and prepare for the possibility of natural and cultural resource loss? Given the pervasiveness of climate change and human influence on nature that are outside our control, how should we interpret policies for managing natural systems? rk management in addressing them. Another intriguing facet of this issue is the contrast between the complexity of the science that demonstrates resource change or vulnerability in some articles and the simplicity of the photos. No article exemplifies this more than the feature on hanges in Denali's glaciers. Repeat photography reveals dramatic changes in a subset of these ciers, but only the science tells he more complete and complex story of climate interactions. It takes experts to unravel the story just as it does to communicate it. Climate change is an issue that requires both to facilitate public understanding.},

abstract = {Urbanization has not only altered land cover types, but also changed acoustic environments to which animals must adapt or emigrate for effective communication. Although many studies have addressed the effects of urban noise on acoustic communication of vocal organisms, little work has been done to understand the acoustic characteristics and the interaction between biological and anthropogenic sounds across urban-rural landscapes. The objectives of this study were to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of soundscape characteristics along an urban-rural gradient, and how soundscape properties are related to avian species community. We established 17 locations across the city of Lansing, Michigan from February to December 2006 to record environmental sounds. A multilevel regression model (MLRM) was used to understand the variability of acoustic power of biological and anthropogenic sounds (biophony and anthrophony) with temporal and spatial data structures. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was employed to investigate how bird species respond along an environmental gradient.We found that soundscape characteristics were associated with the structure and composition of urban-rural landscapes. Biophony was inversely correlated with anthrophony along an urban-rural gradient. The results of the MLRM showed that the acoustic variability of biophony and anthrophony were associated with landscape attributes. The CCA revealed that the distribution of bird species was significantly related to the percent area of different land cover types. The study suggests that recording acoustic characteristics in urban systems can offer opportunities to not only measure ambient noise levels, but also understand how each component of soundscape is related to another. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Landscape characteristics are important but incomplete indicators of ecosystem attributes, as they are limited to visible features of an area (e.g. landforms, flora and fauna, a built environment). The spatial and temporal dynamics of audible ecosystem features are also important aspects of ecosystem health and function. For instance, the relative concentrations of sounds originating from birds or human activities over time and space provide insight into the spatio-temporal dynamics of human-wildlife interactions. This paper extends the concept of spatial patterns of visible features of a landscape to include audible characteristics, or a soundscape. Here, we introduce the concept of soundscape and demonstrate how acoustic signals can be captured and analyzed to characterize the soundscape of an ecosystem as a complementary indicator of ecological conditions. Using acoustic datasets recorded in Nanchang, China and in Michigan, USA, we demonstrate that 1) a suite of soundscape characteristics can be developed and quantified using acoustic signals captured from audio sensing devices, and 2) these soundscape characteristics can provide useful and complementary information about an ecosystem that adds value to traditional landscape ecology. The analytical methods and acoustic sensing technique developed in this research may be used to develop complementary ecological integrity indicators that would allow ecologists to operationally assess and monitor ecological conditions.},

abstract = {During the last 20 years our understanding of the development of complex systems has changed significantly. Two major advancements are catastrophe theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics with its associated theory of self-organization. These theories indicate that complex system development is nonlinear, discontinuous (catastrophes), not predictable (bifurcations), and multivalued (multiple developmental pathways). Ecosystem development should be expected to exhibit these characteristics. Traditional ecological theory has attempted to describe ecosystem stress response using some simple notions such as stability and resiliency. In fact, stress-response must be characterized by a richer set of concepts. The ability of the system to maintain its current operating point in the face of the stress, must be ascertained. If the system changes operating points, there are several questions to be considered: Is the change along the original developmental pathway or a new one? Is the change organizing or disorganizing? Will the system return to its original state? Will the system flip to some new state in a catastrophic way? Is the change acceptable to humans? The integrity of an ecosystem does not reflect a single characteristic of an ecosystem. The concept of integrity must be seen as multidimensional and encompassing a rich set of ecosystem behaviors. A framework of concepts for discussing integrity is presented in this article.},

abstract = {The soundscape was recorded in four selected places in Sequoia National Park CA, to quantify and assess the diurnal and seasonal character of the park's soundscape. The recording sites were selected to represent a combination of elevation and vegetation diversity. Hour-long sound recordings were made by four individuals at each place during fall, spring, summer and winter at dawn, midday, dusk, and midnight with identical recording instrumentation. The recordings of the soundscape were made in an old growth forest (Crescent Meadow), in a foothill oak savanna (Sycamore Spring), in an upland savanna chaparral (Shepherd Saddle) and in a foothill riparian location adjacent to the Kiawah River (Buckeye Flat). Sound recordings were analyzed using a normalized Power Spectral Density (PSD) algorithm and partitioned into 1 kHz intervals based on 12 subsamples from each of the 64 h-long sound recordings. Biological signals (biophony) were based on the highest PSD value within the range of 2–8 kHz. A multilevel analysis (MLA) was used to examine temporal patterns of biophony at four locations in Sequoia National Park. Unsupervised Landsat Thematic Mapper Satellite Imagery identified 25 vegetation regimes in Sequoia National Park. Satellite signatures of the habitat where recordings were made were extracted from the imagery to scale to the region.},

abstract = {This review reports on the effects of human activities on animal acoustic signals published in the literature from 1970 to 2009. Almost 5{\%} of the studies on variation in animal communication tested or hypothesised on human impacts, and showed that habitat fragmentation, direct human disturbance, introduced diseases, urbanization, hunting, chemical and noise pollution may challenge animal acoustic behaviour. Although acoustic adaptations to anthropogenic habitats have been documented, human impacts have most often generated neutral variation or potential maladaptive responses. Negative impacts have been postulated in the sexual signals of fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals; these are concerning as any maladaptive alteration of sexual behaviour may have direct bearings on breeding success and ultimately population growth rate. Acoustic communication also facilitates other vital behaviours influenced by human-driven perturbations. Bat and cetacean echolocation, for instance, is disrupted by noise pollution, whereas bird and mammal alarming is also affected by introduced diseases and hunting. Mammal social signals are sensitive to noise pollution and hunting, and birds selecting habitats by means of acoustic cues are especially vulnerable to habitat loss. Anthropogenic intervention in these cases may have a negative impact on individual survival, recruitment and group cohesion, limiting rescue-effects and triggering Allee effects. Published evidence shows that acoustic variation may be used as an early-warning indicator of perturbations even when not directly affecting individual fitness. Acoustic signalling can be studied in a broad range of ecosystems, can be recorded, analyzed, synthesised and played back with relative ease and limited economic budget, and is sensitive to many types of impacts, thus can have great conservation significance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. A part of biodiversity assessment and monitoring consists in the estimation and track of the changes in species composition and abundance of animal communities. Such a task requires an important sampling over a broad-scale time that is difficult to reach with classical survey methods. Acoustics may offer an alternative to usual techniques by recording the sound produced by vocal animals. Animal species that use sound for communication (sing and/or call) establish an acoustic community when they sing at the same time and at a particular place. The estimation of the acoustic community dynamics could provide indirect cues on what drives changes in community composition and species abundance. 2. Here new methods were developed to estimate the changes in bird communities recorded at three woodland temperate sites in France. Both field recordings and simulated data were used to test whether acoustic dissimilarity indices can be used to estimate changes in the composition of the community. Four dissimilarity indices found in the literature and a new one named Dcf were tested on auditory spectra after transformation to the Mel scale, rather than on classical Fourier frequency spectra. All indices were compared with each other and with compositional indices. 3. The results show that bird communities occurring at the three sites were dynamic with changes of composition with time. Dissimilarities computed on simulated acoustic communities were correlated with compositional dissimilarity but those computed on field recorded communities could not be considered as faithful estimators of community composition variations. However, the indices indicate important dates in community changes around mid-April that were also seen in the composition dynamics. 4. Acoustic dissimilarity indices failed to track accurately changes in species composition of the bird communities. However, these indices, which are easy to compute, still provide information on the acoustic dynamics of bird community. Acoustics might not be considered as a proxy of compositional diversity but rather as another facet of animal diversity that needs to be studied and preserved on its own.

abstract = {Based on the loudness of different soundscape elements perceived on site, soundscapes were analysed in a multi-functional urban area in Rostock, Germany. The aim was to examine how urban soundscape composition changes spatiotemporally at different levels over a relatively large scale, and how soundscape perception is related to the underlying landscape. The results show that although anthropogenic sounds (anthrophony) dominated urban soundscape both spatially and temporally, certain biological sounds (biophony) and geophysical sounds (geophony), especially bird song, also played a significant role. Urban soundscapes showed diverse spatiotemporal patterns. Spatial variation of urban soundscape patterns was explained by underlying landscape characteristics, while temporal variation was mainly driven by urban activities, among which human activities were the major component. It is demonstrated that the thematic soundscape mapping techniques developed in this study is an effective tool. Landscape composition and configuration indicators could affect soundscape perception significantly, among which normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and landscape shape index (LSI) are the two most important predictors. The results highlight the importance of introducing more natural sounds into urban environments to achieve "noise control" through an ecological urban/landscape planning process. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Reliable estimation of the size or density of wild animal populations is very important for effective wildlife management, conservation and ecology. Currently, the most widely used methods for obtaining such estimates involve either sighting animals from transect lines or some form of capture-recapture on marked or uniquely identifiable individuals. However, many species are difficult to sight, and cannot be easily marked or recaptured. Some of these species produce readily identifiable sounds, providing an opportunity to use passive acoustic data to estimate animal density. In addition, even for species for which other visually based methods are feasible, passive acoustic methods offer the potential for greater detection ranges in some environments (e.g. underwater or in dense forest), and hence potentially better precision. Automated data collection means that surveys can take place at times and in places where it would be too expensive or dangerous to send human observers. Here, we present an overview of animal density estimation using passive acoustic data, a relatively new and fast-developing field. We review the types of data and methodological approaches currently available to researchers and we provide a framework for acoustics-based density estimation, illustrated with examples from real-world case studies. We mention moving sensor platforms (e.g. towed acoustics), but then focus on methods involving sensors at fixed locations, particularly hydrophones to survey marine mammals, as acoustic-based density estimation research to date has been concentrated in this area. Primary among these are methods based on distance sampling and spatially explicit capture-recapture. The methods are also applicable to other aquatic and terrestrial sound-producing taxa. We conclude that, despite being in its infancy, density estimation based on passive acoustic data likely will become an important method for surveying a number of diverse taxa, such as sea mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and insects, especially in situations where inferences are required over long periods of time. There is considerable work ahead, with several potentially fruitful research areas, including the development of (i) hardware and software for data acquisition, (ii) efficient, calibrated, automated detection and classification systems, and (iii) statistical approaches optimized for this application. Further, survey design will need to be developed, and research is needed on the acoustic behaviour of target species. Fundamental research on vocalization rates and group sizes, and the relation between these and other factors such as season or behaviour state, is critical. Evaluation of the methods under known density scenarios will be important for empirically validating the approaches presented here.},

abstract = {1. Sound transmission was measured in open fields, mixed decidous forest with and without leaves and coniferous forest in Dutchess County, New York. Attenuation of white noise and pure tones was measured between one microphone close to a loudspeaker and another microphone 100 m away, at the same height. Graphs of excess attenuation (E.A. in dB/100 m) against frequency were obtained at 0.15, 1, 2, 5, and 10 m above the ground. An analysis of variance was conducted to estimate effects of height, frequency and habitat. 2. Height and frequency affect sound transmission more than habitat. With a sound source close to the ground (15 cm and 1 m) all frequencies were more attenuated than at greater heights. The patterns of E.A. as a function of sound frequency were basically similar in all habitats. At all source heights the lower the frequency the better the sound carried, with the exception that close to the ground, sounds below 2 kHz were excessively attenuated. Comparing open field and forest, trees improved transmission of frequencies below 3 kHz, especially close to the ground. 3. Some general trends can be predicted for maximization of transmission distances of animal sounds in these habitats. For an animal vocalizing higher than 1 m above the ground, the lower the frequency the further the sound travels. Close to the ground, low frequencies are again preferred for maximization of transmission distances, but the frequencies must be pitched above a range of attenuated, low-pitched sounds, the limits of which vary to some extent with habitat, creating the 'sound window' of Morton. This 'window' of least-attenuated frequencies, only occurring close to the ground, tends to be pitched somewhat lower in forest than in open habitats. However, for an animal producing sounds in the habitats tested, perch height and sound frequency are more important than the habitat in determining how far the sound will carry. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 1977 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The study of landscape structure and functions, including the underlying ecological and anthropogenic processes has traditionally relied on visual aspects without considering information of non-visionary cues, e.g. auditory. In this work we applied a complementary approach for the study of landscapes using qualitative information for the sonic environment. In particular we studied the qualitative linkages between landscape structure and functions and daily sound patterns. The main objectives were the investigation of the spatial and temporal variability in sound perception, and the identification of the dominant sound categories (anthropogenic, biological, geophysical originated sounds) in relation to landscape characteristics. Our results showed significant spatio-temporal variability in the intensity of different sound categories, which reflects distinct soundscape patterns. Temporal sound variability reflected the daily cycle of anthropogenic activities and biological processes, whereas the spatial sound viability was mainly shaped by landscape attributes. The combination of the visual landscape information and its emergent acoustic profile enhances our perception and understanding of nature and this integrated approach may have many practical applications in landscape management, monitoring and planning.},

abstract = {Abstract  So far landscape analysis meant analysis of the spatial pattern of land cover or land use. However, biological organisms do not perceive the landscape only as land cover or land use, but they use all their senses, in order to become familiar with and react to their surroundings. We analyzed the acoustic environment as an additional layer of spatial information in landscape analysis, shortening the monopoly of visual patterns as landscape descriptors. We recorded sounds from a rural protected area into seven categories based on their origin, and examined their spatiotemporal variability and their correlation with landscape characteristics. The sounds were distinguished as Foreground or Background sounds. Foreground sounds correspond to sharp sounds originating near the observer and usually are understood as signals of urgent information, triggering reactions; while background sounds carry information over longer distances and may be used as landmarks to help individuals find their bearing even in the absence of visual signs. We found that the acoustic environment varies both temporally and spatially reflecting anthropogenic, geophysical and biological activities. The spatial pattern of the background sounds correlates, to an extent, with the visually perceived landscape features, but it does not correlate with the spatial pattern of the foreground sounds, which do not correlate strongly with the landscape pattern. This spatial pattern mismatch between acoustic environment and landscape, along with the highly dynamic nature of the acoustic environment compared to the relatively static nature of the land cover and land use spatial pattern highlight a limitation of the classical landscape analysis, and expands our understanding of the cognitive landscape.},

abstract = {Habitat loss is a critical threat to tropical biodiversity and its quantification constitutes a central conservation issue. Typically, assessments have been based on deforestation rates statistics. However, this overlooks the effects brought about by the spatial reconfiguration of the remaining habitat: fragmentation. We present an analysis of fragmentation in a Neotropical site aimed at: (a) devising a protocol for its quantification, (b) using such protocol to provide insights on the ecological consequences of fragmentation, (c) exploring its applicability to address the hypothesis that forest size-inequality decreases with elevation, an indicator of habitat accessibility. We applied the Gini coefficient (G) and the Lorenz curve to analyze fragment-size variation using a satellite-generated map. We also estimated edge effect, fragment shape and isolation. Remaining forest includes 1,005 fragments, ranging from 0.5 to 9.356 ha (median = 0.89). Size inequality was very high (G = 0.928), producing a flattened Lorenz curve. Forty percent of the fragments did not maintain an area free of a 30-m edge effect, and larger fragments showed a marked deviation from ideal circular forms. Eighty-four percent of the fragments lay further than 500 m from the largest forest tract and their size decreased with distance. Fragment size distribution changed with altitude: the Gini coefficient was lowest and forest coverage was greatest at the highest altitude, but inequality peaked at an intermediate elevation. Given the current pace of habitat deterioration, application of similar analyses may improve global assessments of tropical ecosystems and their perspectives for biodiversity conservation. Key words: edge effect, fragment shape, Gini coefficient, Lorenz curve, tropical rain forest.},

abstract = {1. Using arrays of microphones, biologists can monitor the position of free-living animals based on the sounds they produce. Microphone array technology exploits differences in sound arrival times at each microphone to calculate an animal's position. This technology provides new opportunities for studying animal ecology and behaviour and has many advantages over tracking technologies that require capturing animals and fitting them with external devices, or technologies that focus on one individual in isolation of the activities of nearby animals. 2. The efficacy of microphone arrays for triangulating the position of wild animals has been established through previous studies. Yet widespread use of microphone array technology has been limited by many factors: arrays are expensive, custom manufactured, and cumbersome. Consequently, microphone arrays are used infrequently, in spite of their transformative potential for studying animal ecology and behaviour. 3. We conducted a field test of a new wireless microphone array system that has multiple advantages over previous systems: it is relatively inexpensive, commercially available, includes an integrated global positioning system (GPS) for time-synchronizing microphones, and it is small enough to fit in a backpack. We set up an array of four stereo recorders (each with a pair of stereo microphones) at 12 sites and tested the system's accuracy for estimating the location of loudspeakers broadcasting 25 types of bird, mammal and frog sounds. 4. We found that this system produced accurate location estimates based on multi-channel recordings of many types of acoustic signals. The average location accuracy was 1{\textperiodcentered}87 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}13 m, on par with cable-based microphone array systems. Location accuracy was significantly higher when the recorders were closer together and when sounds were broadcast inside the area bounded by the microphones. Accuracy tended to be higher in field vs. forest habitats. 5. We discuss how this system may be used to enhance studies of animal ecology and behaviour across a wide range of contexts. As with previous arrays, this system will allow researchers to monitor animals that produce distinctive acoustic signals. In contrast to previous microphone arrays, this system is affordable, portable and commercially available. Consequently, this system stands to dramatically enhance research on wild, free-living animals.},

abstract = {This paper offers a new approach to understanding, improving and designing soundscapes. “Soundscape” means all the sounds that can be heard in a specific location. Soundscapes can be understood only through peoples' perceptions, and this paper proposes using those perceptions to link soundscape improvement and design with traditional noise control methods. Decades of experience have yielded in-depth understanding of how undesirable sounds may be controlled or reduced. The control methods, however, are generally applicable to single sources of sound while soundscapes are composed of multiple sounds. Using human judgments, first in the laboratory and later in the field, it will be possible to deconstruct any soundscape into its desirable and undesirable sounds, which may then, one-by-one, be subjected to proven methods of noise control. This approach includes complications, not the least of which is deciding how much the undesirable sounds should be reduced to perceptually improve the soundscape. Previous published studies, primarily laboratory, but also field studies, suggest that initial laboratory work followed by increasingly complex field applications, should result in an understanding of how soundscapes can be improved and desirable ones designed.},

abstract = {This paper explores the reasons behind the omission of historic acoustic values from heritage assessments in Australia. Best practice dictates that all cultural heritage values associated with significant places should be assessed in order to make informed conservation and management decisions. However, the multi-sensory nature of aesthetics has been reframed in guidance documentation in ways that run counter to the primary frame. Conventions that have developed around the way places are assessed also work against comprehensive identification of values. As a result, the consideration of aesthetics in cultural heritage is limited to contemporary visual qualities. Furthermore, because the assessment of historic value takes a diachronic rather than synchronic approach, we have little knowledge of the places past communities valued for the sounds they experienced there. Research into landscape preference and acoustic ecology highlights the importance of identifying the inherent acoustic dimension of places and the role sound plays in developing a sense of place. Two landscape areas in Western Australia's south-west with historic acoustic values, the Boranup Sand Patch and the Lower Reaches of the Blackwood River, illustrate how historic soundscapes can provide insightful contrasts and resonances with contemporary values, and how vulnerable such places are when the sound of place is overlooked in land management policies.},

abstract = {Understanding the response of species to changes in landscape configuration is required to design adequate management and conservation strategies. Yet, the most appropriate spatial scale (i.e., landscape size) to assess the response of species to changes in landscape configuration (so-called "scale of effect") is largely unknown. In this paper, we assess the impact of landscape forest cover, forest fragmentation, edge density, and inter-patch isolation distance on the diet and behavior of six communities of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) in the fragmented Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. We evaluated the strength of the relationship between each landscape predictor and each response variable within ten different-sized landscapes (range = 50-665 ha) to identify the landscape size that best predicted changes in diet and behavior. The strength of most associations varied across spatial scales, with the 126-ha landscape showing the strongest relationships between landscape predictors and response variables in many cases. Yet forest cover represented the main driver of the diet and behavior of spider monkeys, being positively associated with time traveling and time feeding on wood, but negatively related to time resting and time feeding on leaves. Although weaker, the impact of edge density was opposite to forest cover for most response variables. Forest fragmentation and isolation distance showed the weakest associations with the diet and behavior of this species. Our findings thus indicate that different landscape attributes operate on different response variables at different spatial scales.

abstract = {Long-term monitoring of frog populations is needed to understand the effects of global change. To better understand the relationships between climate variation and calling activity, we monitored an anuran assemblage in a Puerto Rican wetland by sampling the acoustic environment for one minute every 10 minutes, for 41 months. By automating data collection using passive acoustic monitoring hardware, we collected more than 110,000 recordings. These recordings were analyzed using species-specific identification algorithms of four Eleutherodactylus species. The peak calling activity of E. coqui ({\textgreater}0.3 detection frequency) and E. cochranae ({\textgreater}0.2) occurred between April and September, and there was a clear decline in activity during the dry months of January–March. There was no clear annual pattern in E. brittoni or E. juanariveroi, but E. juanariveroi did show a significant decline in calling activity over the 41-month study (∼0.5 to ∼0.35). Calling activity of E. coqui and E. cochranae was positively correlated...},

abstract = {Concurrent with the elevation of the concern over the state of sound in the ocean, advances in terrestrial acoustic monitoring techniques have produced concepts and tools that may be applicable to the underwater world. Several index values that convey information related to acoustic diversity with a single numeric measurement made from acoustic recordings have been proposed for rapidly assessing community biodiversity. Here we apply the acoustic biodiversity index method to low frequency recordings made from three different ocean basins to assess its appropriateness for characterizing species richness in the marine environment. Initial results indicated that raw acoustic entropy (H) values did not correspond to biological patterns identified from individual signal detections and classification. Noise from seismic airgun activity masked the weaker biological signals and confounded the entropy calculation. A simple background removal technique that subtracted an average complex spectrum characteristic of seismic exploration signals from the average spectra of each analysis period that contained seismic signals was applied to compensate for salient seismic airgun signals present in all locations. The noise compensated (HN) entropy index was more reflective of biological patterns and holds promise for the use of rapid acoustic biodiversity in the marine environment as an indicator of habitat biodiversity and health. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We determined the relationship between acoustic diversity and metrics of vertical forest structure derived from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data in a neotropical rainforest in Costa Rica. We then used the LIDAR-derived metrics to predict acoustic diversity across the forest landscape. Sound recordings were obtained from 14 sites for six consecutive days during dusk chorus (6 pm). Acoustic diversity was calculated for each day as the total intensity across acoustic frequency bands using the Shannon index and then averaged over the 6 days at each site. A 10 m radius around each site was used to obtain several LIDAR-derived metrics describing the vertical structural attributes of the forest canopy. Multiple linear regression (MLR) with Akaike information criterion was used to determine a top-ranked model with acoustic diversity as the dependent variable and the LIDAR metrics as independent variables. Acoustic diversity was modeled for forested areas (where canopy height was {\textgreater} 20 m) at 20 m resolution using coefficients obtained from the MLR, and a hotspot analysis was conducted on the resulting layer. Acoustic diversity was strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.75) with the LIDAR metrics suggesting that LIDAR-derived metrics can be used to determine canopy structural attributes important to vocal fauna species. The hotspot analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of these canopy structural attributes across the La Selva forest is not random. Our approach can be used to identify forest patches of potentially high acoustic diversity for conservation or management purposes.},

abstract = {The animal soundscape is a field of growing interest because of the implications it has for human-landscape interactions. Yet, it continues to be a difficult subject to investigate, due to the huge amount of information which it contains. In this contribution, the suitability of the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) is examined. It is an algorithm created to produce a direct quantification of the complex biotic songs by computing the variability of the intensities registered in audio-recordings, despite the presence of constant human-generated-noise. Twenty audio-recordings were made at equally spaced locations in a beech mountain forest in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennine National Park (Italy) between June and July 2008. The study area is characterized by the absence of recent human disturbance to forest assets but the presence of airplane routes does bring engine noise that overlaps and mixes with the natural soundscape, which resulted entirely composed by bird songs. The intensity values and frequency bin occurrences of soundscapes, the total number of bird vocalizations and the ACI were processed by using the Songscope v2.1 and Avisoft v4.40 software. The Spearman's rho calculation highlighted a significant correlation between the ACI values and the number of bird vocalizations, while the frequency bin occurrence and acoustic intensity were weaker correlated to bird singing activity because of the inclusion of all of the other geo/anthro-phonies composing the soundscape. The ACI tends to be efficient in filtering out anthrophonies (such as airplane engine noise), and demonstrates the capacity to synthetically and efficiently describe the complexity of bird soundscapes. Finally, this index offers new opportunities for the monitoring of songbird communities faced with the challenge of human-induced disturbances and other proxies like climate and land use changes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We summarize the foundational elements of a new area of research we call soundscape ecology. The study of sound in landscapes is based on an understanding of how sound, from various sources— biological, geophysical and anthropogenic—can be used to understand coupled natural-human dynamics across different spatial and temporal scales. Useful terms, such as soundscapes, biophony, geophony and anthrophony, are introduced and defined. The intellectual foundations of soundscape ecology are described—those of spatial ecology, bioacoustics, urban environmental acoustics and acoustic ecology. We argue that soundscape ecology differs from the humanities driven focus of acoustic ecology although soundscape ecology will likely need its rich vocabulary and conservation ethic. An integrative framework is presented that describes how climate, land transformations, biodiversity patterns, timing of life history events and human activities create the dynamic soundscape. We also summarize what is currently known about factors that control temporal soundscape dynamics and variability across spatial gradients. Several different phonic interactions (e.g., how anthrophony affects biophony) are also described. Soundscape ecology tools that will be needed are also discussed along with the several ways in which soundscapes need to be managed. This summary article helps frame the other more application- oriented papers that appear in this special issue.},

Our conceptual framework of soundscape ecology is based on the causes and consequences of biological (biophony), geophysical (geophony), and human-produced (anthrophony) sounds. We argue that soundscape ecology shares many parallels with landscape ecology, and it should therefore be considered a branch of this maturing field. We propose a research agenda for soundscape ecology that includes six areas: (1) measurement and analytical challenges, (2) spatial-temporal dynamics, (3) soundscape linkage to environmental covariates, (4) human impacts on the soundscape, (5) soundscape impacts on humans, and (6) soundscape impacts on ecosystems. We present case studies that illustrate different approaches to understanding soundscape dynamics. Because soundscapes are our auditory link to nature, we also argue for their protection, using the knowledge of how sounds are produced by the environment and humans.},

abstract = {There is a rich literature on automatic species identification of a specific target taxon as regards various vocalizing animals. Research usually is restricted to specific species - in most cases a single one. It is only very recently that the number of monitored species has started to increase for certain habitats involving birds. Automatic acoustic monitoring has not yet been proven to be generic enough to scale to other taxa and habitats than the ones described in the original research. Although attracting much attention, the acoustic monitoring procedure is neither well established yet nor universally adopted as a biodiversity monitoring tool. Recently, the multi-instance multi-label framework on bird vocalizations has been introduced to face the obstacle of simultaneously vocalizing birds of different species. We build on this framework to integrate novel, image-based heterogeneous features designed to capture different aspects of the spectrum. We applied our approach to a taxon-rich habitat that included 78 birds, 8 insect species and 1 amphibian. This dataset constituted the Multi-label Bird Species Classification Challenge-NIPS 2013 where the proposed approach achieved an average accuracy of 91.25{\%} on unseen data.},

abstract = {The primary purpose for pursuing this research is to present a modular approach that enables reliable automatic bird species identification on the basis of their sound emissions in the field. A practical and complete computer-based framework is proposed to detect and time-stamp particular bird species in continuous real field recordings. Acoustic detection of avian sounds can be used for the automatized monitoring of multiple bird taxa and querying in long-term recordings for species of interest for researchers, conservation practitioners, and decision makers, such as environmental indicator taxa and threatened species. This work describes two novel procedures and offers an open modular framework that detects and time-stamps online calls and songs of target bird species and is fast enough to report results in reasonable time for non-processed field recordings of many thousands files and is generic enough to accommodate any species. The framework is evaluated on two large corpora of real field data, targeting the calls and songs of American Robin Turdus migratorius, a Northamerican oscine passerine (true songbird) and the Common Kingfisher Alcedo atthis, a non-passerine species with a wide distribution throughout Eurasia and North Africa. With the aim of promoting the widespread use of digital autonomous recording units (ARUs) and species recognition technologies the processing code and a large corpus of audio recordings is provided in order to enable other researchers to perform and assess comparative experiments. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Omnidirectional bioacoustic recording systems offer the ability to record forest songbirds in the field by technical staff, and then interpret the recordings later in the laboratory by skilled interpreters. Among several advantages to this approach are the ability to estimate variance among interpreters, obtain a permanent archival record of the point count, reduce costs by using regular field crews to collect data vs. those skilled in bird identification, and remove impediments to breeding bird surveys due to lack of available skilled birders. In this study we first evaluated the effects of microphone configuration and digital processing methods on the quality and effectiveness of the recordings, and then evaluated how consistently skilled birders interpreted the same songbird recordings collected under a mix of environmental conditions, and related this to the commonness of the species. At the time of this evaluation, the most cost-effective configuration of the bioacoustic monitoring system included use of a 180°/180° microphone combination, a minidisc digital recording system, analog transfer of the sound data via a digital soundcard, post-processing amplification of the signal, and data storage in an .MP3 format. This combination maintains high sound fidelity while minimizing both expense and data storage requirements. As recording device technology improves, the direct storage and digital transfer of .WAV format files will be the preferred and most effective recording option. Despite noisy conditions due to wind and other ambient sounds for many of the recordings, interpreters showed a high level of similarity in species identification and enumeration for the 34 most abundant species. Standardized coefficient of variance increased sharply when species had fewer than 10 occurrences, suggesting that birders are more variable in their identification of rare or uncommon species. Desktop identification systems that include type specimens of spectrographic signature and sound clips to aid interpreters could improve identification accuracy of rarer species. /// Los sistemas de grabaci{\'{o}}n bioac{\'{u}}sticos omnidireccionales permiten grabar aves de bosque por personal t{\'{e}}cnico y luego la interpretaci{\'{o}}n de lo grabado por personal versado o con buena experiencia en el laboratorio.

abstract = {Soundscape ecology aims to use biological, geophysical and anthropogenic sound to understand natural-human landscape dynamics. The analysis of natural soundscapes with no human noise is a prerequisite to understand and quantify the effects of human activity on animal ecology linked to sound. Preserved tropical forests are the location of unique, highly diverse, and animal sound. However, although the acoustic behavior of several tropical species has been examined, very few analyses have attempted tropical sounds at a spatial scale able to incorporate landscape characters. Here we analyze the acoustic structure of a neotropical forest landscape in French Guiana. We used a four dimensional synchronous acoustic sampling (three spatial dimensions and the temporal dimension) by deploying an array of 24 microphones in the understory and canopy of the Nouragues Nature Reserve during a 43. day period and we undertook a detailed signal analysis to detect spatial and temporal animal acoustic heterogeneity. We identified a clear pattern of acoustic activity with four distinct periods of activity that differed by their spectral characteristics indicating acoustic heterogeneity along the 24-hour. cycle but periodicity at a longer time scale. We revealed acoustic divergences between the understory and the canopy layers in terms of amplitude level and frequency content. We highlighted vertical (understory/canopy) and horizontal acoustic heterogeneities with a more diverse (frequency) patch in the north of the study area sampled and a more active (intensity) patch in the southeast of the study area. Our results show that the soundscape of a tropical forest, in the absence of human disturbance, is subtly structured in time and is heterogeneous in space. This structure is probably linked to endogenous factors that rule out the acoustic time activity of animal species, to the vertical stratification of singing communities or guilds, to horizontal variations in the distributions of species and to vegetation spatial heterogeneity. Our study emphasizes that tropical soundscapes need to be recorded and analyzed in considerable spatial and temporal detail to understand their dynamics without the presence of human produced noise. Our analysis also suggests that tropical forests are unique places for acoustic diversity, supporting the need for preservation from all perturbations including anthropic noise. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A soundscape assessment method that is suitable for the automatic categorization of binaurally recorded sound in urban public places is presented. Soundscape categories are established as a result of an automatic clustering algorithm based on multi-parameter analysis by 13 acoustical parameters used as similarity measures, on a large set of sound recordings. One of the main advantages of the followed approach allows to take into account an optimized set of parameters that are judged relevant and necessary for an appropriate description of the sampled acoustical scenarios. The Euclidian distance based clustering of the 370 recordings of typical situations based on these parameters, allows to categorize each binaurally recorded sound sample into one of 20 proposed clusters (soundscape categories). The common features among members within each cluster allow to identify "how the acoustical scenario of the members sounds like". The hybrid use of an optimized set of standard acoustical quantities, such as sound pressure level, together with well known psychoacoustical parameters that directly relate to human perception of sound, makes the propose method very robust. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We detected {\textgreater}60,000 flight calls from migratory birds and classified 45,775 calls to species level or to a bioacoustic category comprising several species with similar calls. We compared these acoustic data with records of 5,624 birds captured in mist nets.

abstract = {Fuel economy and emission abatement are issues, which are highly prioritized areas in the automotive industry of today. The debate about climate change has in recent years even more emphasized the importance of these issues and has increased the search for finding sustainable technical solutions. This paper describes an effort to develop an innovative and environmentally-benign hydrogen generation system operating on commercial diesel fuel to avoid running the engine to supply electricity at stand-still. The use of a fuel cell-based auxiliary power unit (APU) has the potential of delivering electricity at high efficiencies independent of the heavy-duty truck engine. During the reformer development phase, spray formation and mixing of reactants proved to be crucial to obtain high reforming efficiencies and low diesel slip. The diesel is being injected through a nozzle creating a spray of fine droplets of a size which can establish rapid evaporation. Air and steam are being pre-heated and injected into the mixture chamber and subsequently mixed with the evaporated diesel fuel. Depending on the operating parameters, a part of the fuel is being oxidized and produces heat. Autothermal reforming was chosen to circumvent the heat transfer problem in catalytic steam reforming. By supplying heat directly to the catalyst surface by an oxidation reaction the heat demand of the strongly endothermic steam reforming reaction can be fulfilled. We employed CFD calculations, which revealed the importance of avoiding large recirculation zones leading to a prolonged residence time of the hydrocarbon molecules and causing auto-ignition and excessive temperatures in the catalyst. Five different reformer generations are being described and discussed in detail in this publication. The first one was based on a fixed bed reactor, while the other four all relied on catalytic monoliths enabling low pressure drops. The early reactor designs all suffered from auto-ignition and instability problems. The latter generations exhibited a considerably more stable temperature profile in the reformer. The conversion of diesel and the reformer efficiencies are significantly higher than the early generation diesel reformers. (C) 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

abstract = {Many animal species use acoustic signals to attract mates, to defend territories, or to convey information that may contribute to their fitness in other ways. However, the natural environment is usually filled with competing sounds. Therefore, if ambient noise conditions are relatively constant, acoustic interference can drive evolutionary changes in animal signals. Furthermore, masking noise may cause acoustic divergence between populations of the same species if noise conditions differ consistently among habitats. In this study, ambient noise was sampled in a replicate set of sites in two habitat types in Cameroon: contiguous rainforest and ecotone forest patches north of the rainforest. The noise characteristics of the two forest types show significant and consistent differences. Multiple samples taken at two rainforest sites in different seasons vary little and remain distinct from those in ecotone forest. The rainforest recordings show many distinctive frequency bands, with a general increase in amplitude from low to high frequencies. Ecotone forest only shows a distinctive high-frequency band at some parts of the day. Habitat-dependent abiotic and biotic sound sources and to some extent habitat-dependent sound transmission are the likely causes of these habitat-dependent noise spectra.

abstract = {Automatic species classification of birds from their sound is a computational tool of increasing importance in ecology, conservation monitoring and vocal communication studies. To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial to improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many approaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a manually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data can often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can be performed at large scale and "unsupervised", meaning it requires no manual data labelling, yet it can improve performance on "supervised" tasks such as classification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from large volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven useful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature representations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this technique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, with a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that MFCCs are of limited power in this context, leading to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data. Conversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a substantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational complexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable for single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal activations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive fields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain.},

abstract = {Multispecies cicada communities in neotropical rainforests produce a complex and intense acoustic environment. In a fragment of a Mexican rainforest (Veracruz, Mexico), a cicada community at the end of the dry season consisted of nine species (Daza montezuma; Pacarina schumanni; Miranha imbellis; Dorisiana sutori; Fidicinoides picea; Fidicinoides pronoe; Quesada gigas; one species of the genus Neocicada and one uncaught canopy species). Seven of the nine species formed dense choruses at dawn and at dusk. Each species showed preferences in the height of calling sites. Males of the species were solitary or gregarious, and followed a ‘call-fly' or a ‘call-stay' calling strategy. Acoustic signals of each species had particular time and frequency patterns. All these specific features appear to separate the nine species acoustically and lead to a partitioning of the acoustic environment. The acoustic partitioning might decrease the risk of heterospecific courting and mating.{\textcopyright} 2002 The Linnean Society of London,},

If acoustic signals are undoubtedly a vehicle for exchanging information between individuals, environmental sounds embed as well a significant level of data related to the ecology of populations, communities and landscapes. The consideration of environmental sounds for ecological investigations opens up a field of research that we define with the term ecoacoustics. In this paper, we draw the contours of ecoacoustics by detailing: the main theories, concepts and methods used in ecoacoustic research, and the numerous outcomes that can be expected from the ecological approach to sound. Ecoacoustics has several theoretical and practical challenges, but we firmly believe that this new approach to investigating ecological processes will generate abundant and exciting research programs.},

abstract = {Bioacoustics is historically adiscipline that essentially focuses on individual behaviour in relation to population and species evolutionary levels butrarely in connection with higher levels of ecological complexity likecom- munity,landscape or ecosystem. However, some recent bioacoustic researches have operated achange of scale by developing acoustic indices which aim is to characterize animal acoustic communities and soundscapes. We here reviewthese indices for the first time. The indices can be divided into twoclasses: the $\alpha$ or within-group indices and the $\beta$ or between-group indices. Up to 21 $\alpha$ acoustic indices were proposed in less than six years. These indices estimate the amplitude, evenness, richness, heterogeneity of an acoustic community or soundscape. Seven $\beta$ diversity indices were suggested to compare amplitude envelopes or,more often, frequencyspectral pro- files. Both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ indices reported congruent and expected results buttheymay still suffer some bias due, for instance, to anthropic background noise or variations in the distances between vocalising animals and the sensors. Research is still needed to improve the reliability of these newmathematical tools for biodiversity assessment and monitoring. We recommend the contemporary use of some of these indices to obtain complementary informa- tion. Eventually,weforesee that this newfield of research which tries to build bridges between animal behaviour and ecology should meet an important success in the next years for the assessment and monitoring of marine, freshwater and terrestrial biodiversity from individual-based leveltolandscape dimension.},

abstract = {Biodiversity assessment remains one of the most difficult challenges encountered by ecologists and conservation biologists. This task is becoming even more urgent with the current increase of habitat loss. Many methods-from rapid biodiversity assessments (RBA) to all-taxa biodiversity inventories (ATBI)-have been developed for decades to estimate local species richness. However, these methods are costly and invasive. Several animals-birds, mammals, amphibians, fishes and arthropods-produce sounds when moving, communicating or sensing their environment. Here we propose a new concept and method to describe biodiversity. We suggest to forego species or morphospecies identification used by ATBI and RBA respectively but rather to tackle the problem at another evolutionary unit, the community level. We also propose that a part of diversity can be estimated and compared through a rapid acoustic analysis of the sound produced by animal communities. We produced alpha and beta diversity indexes that we first tested with 540 simulated acoustic communities. The alpha index, which measures acoustic entropy, shows a logarithmic correlation with the number of species within the acoustic community. The beta index, which estimates both temporal and spectral dissimilarities, is linearly linked to the number of unshared species between acoustic communities. We then applied both indexes to two closely spaced Tanzanian dry lowland coastal forests. Indexes reveal for this small sample a lower acoustic diversity for the most disturbed forest and acoustic dissimilarities between the two forests suggest that degradation could have significantly decreased and modified community composition. Our results demonstrate for the first time that an indicator of biological diversity can be reliably obtained in a non-invasive way and with a limited sampling effort. This new approach may facilitate the appraisal of animal diversity at large spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Birdsong provides a unique model for understanding the behavioral and neural bases underlying complex sequential behaviors. However, birdsong analyses require laborious effort to make the data quantitatively analyzable. The previous attempts had succeeded to provide some reduction of human efforts involved in birdsong segment classification. The present study was aimed to further reduce human efforts while increasing classification performance. In the current proposal, a linear-kernel support vector machine was employed to minimize the amount of human-generated label samples for reliable element classification in birdsong, and to enable the classifier to handle highly-dimensional acoustic features while avoiding the over-fitting problem. Bengalese finch's songs in which distinct elements (i.e., syllables) were aligned in a complex sequential pattern were used as a representative test case in the neuroscientific research field. Three evaluations were performed to test (1) algorithm validity and accuracy with exploring appropriate classifier settings, (2) capability to provide accuracy with reducing amount of instruction dataset, and (3) capability in classifying large dataset with minimized manual labeling. The results from the evaluation (1) showed that the algorithm is 99.5{\%} reliable in song syllables classification. This accuracy was indeed maintained in evaluation (2), even when the instruction data classified by human were reduced to one-minute excerpt (corresponding to 300–400 syllables) for classifying two-minute excerpt. The reliability remained comparable, 98.7{\%} accuracy, when a large target dataset of whole day recordings (∼30,000 syllables) was used. Use of a linear-kernel support vector machine showed sufficient accuracies with minimized manually generated instruction data in bird song element classification. The methodology proposed would help reducing laborious processes in birdsong analysis without sacrificing reliability, and therefore can help accelerating behavior and studies using songbirds.},

Our method is based on acoustic parameters (features) taken from the first harmonic component computed from the sound spectrogram. The features are based on a line segment approximation of the first harmonic component. The final feature vectors, consisting of 16 real numbers, are then classified using a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. Flight calls of four crossbill species (Loxia spp.) are used as a test example. In the first phase, an unsupervised network was trained and tested using common crossbill L. curvirostra flight calls recorded mainly in the Netherlands. The network was tested using two-barred L. leucoptera, Scottish L. scotica and parrot L. pytyopsittacus crossbill flight calls in the second phase. Finally, the results were validated applying the same network to flight calls of common crossbills and parrot crossbills recorded in Finland. The method automatically separated common crossbill flight calls from those of parrot crossbills. The classification accuracy of the Dutch recordings was 58{\%} in the first phase and 54{\%} in the second phase. The Finnish recordings were classified with 54{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {Point-count surveys are widely used to infer avian presence and estimate species richness. Advancements in bioacoustic technology enable automated surveys that can supplement human-based point-count surveys with expanded temporal and spatial coverage. We surveyed birds in 13 Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range (CA, USA) montane meadows from May to August 2006 using 8 point-count surveys and automated audio recorders (ARU) to compare species richness between the 2 methods and evaluate the use of ARUs as a monitoring tool. We analyzed species richness using 30 minutes of ARU data per point and 2 point-count surveys. Automated audio-recorder data revealed 14 species per meadow (56 species total) while point counts detected 16 species per meadow (67 species total). Automated audio recorders provided {\textgreater}1,100 additional hours of data with personnel effort similar to 2 point-count surveys. An asymptote in species richness was reached for every meadow using ARU data and 8 of 13 meadows using 2 point-count surveys. We detected 81 species during all 8 point-count surveys. We used SonoBird (DNDesign, Arcata, CA) software to search for 24 species detected by point-count surveys but not in the manually sampled subset of audio files. We detected 22 additional species, bringing the total audio-file species detections to 85, 4 more than detected by 8 point-count surveys. We conclude that audio recordings and analysis provide an alternative to avian point-count surveys or as a supplement to increase their accuracy, particularly over larger temporal and spatial scales, or for species with low detectability.},

abstract = {Interpreting acoustic recordings of the natural environment is an increasingly important technique for ecologists wishing to monitor terrestrial ecosystems. Technological advances make it possible to accumulate many more recordings than can be listened to or interpreted, thereby necessitating automated assistance to identify elements in the soundscape. In this paper we examine the problem of estimating avian species richness by sampling from very long acoustic recordings. We work with data recorded under natural conditions and with all the attendant problems of undefined and unconstrained acoustic content (such as wind, rain, traffic, etc.) which can mask content of interest (in our case, bird calls). We describe 14 acoustic indices calculated at one minute resolution for the duration of a 24 hour recording. An acoustic index is a statistic that summarizes some aspect of the structure and distribution of acoustic energy and information in a recording. Some of the indices we calculate are standard (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio), some have been reported useful for the detection of bioacoustic activity (e.g. temporal and spectral entropies) and some are directed to avian sources (spectral persistence of whistles). We rank the one minute segments of a 24 hour recording in descending order according to an "acoustic richness" score which is derived from a single index or a weighted combination of two or more. We describe combinations of indices which lead to more efficient estimates of species richness than random sampling from the same recording, where efficiency is defined as total species identified for given listening effort. Using random sampling, we achieve a 53{\%} increase in species recognized over traditional field surveys and an increase of 87{\%} using combinations of indices to direct the sampling. We also demonstrate how combinations of the same indices can be used to detect long duration acoustic events (such as heavy rain and cicada chorus) and to construct long duration (24 h) spectrograms. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Acoustic recordings of the environment are an important aid to ecologists monitoring biodiversity and environmental health. However, rapid advances in recording technology, storage and computing make it possible to accumulate thousands of hours of recordings, of which, ecologists can only listen to a small fraction. The big-data challenge addressed in this paper is to visualize the content of long-duration audio recordings on multiple scales, from hours, days, months to years. The visualization should facilitate navigation and yield ecologically meaningful information. Our approach is to extract (at one minute resolution) acoustic indices which reflect content of ecological interest. An acoustic index is a statistic that summarizes some aspect of the distribution of acoustic energy in a recording. We combine indices to produce false-color images that reveal acoustic content and facilitate navigation through recordings that are months or even years in duration. {\textcopyright} The Authors.

abstract = {Natural landscapes are increasingly subjected to anthropogenic pressure and fragmentation resulting in reduced ecological condition. In this study we examined the relationship between ecological condition and the soundscape in fragmented forest remnants of south-east Queensland, Australia. The region is noted for its high biodiversity value and increased pressure associated with habitat fragmentation and urbanisation. Ten sites defined by a distinct open eucalypt forest community dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora ssp. variegata) were stratified based on patch size and patch connectivity. Each site underwent a series of detailed vegetation condition and landscape assessments, together with bird surveys and acoustic analysis using relative soundscape power. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that the measurement of relative soundscape power reflects ecological condition and bird species richness, and is dependent on the extent of landscape fragmentation. We conclude that acoustic monitoring technologies provide a cost effective tool for measuring ecological condition, especially in conjunction with established field observations and recordings. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

While only the preservation of large areas of tropical rain forest can safeguard the complete biota, recent research has shown that a substantial number of forest species can persist for decades in fragmented forest, though large vertebrates are susceptible to habitat fragmentation. Inevitably, small fragments will become the last refuges of many rainforest species that are on the brink of extinction. In areas with little rain forest remaining, fragments can be the 'seeds' from which to re-establish extensive forest.},

abstract = {Ecoacoustic monitoring has proved to be a viable approach to capture ecological data related to animal communities. While experts can manually annotate audio samples, the analysis of large datasets can be significantly facilitated by automatic pattern recognition methods. Unsupervised learning methods, which do not require labelled data, are particularly well suited to analyse poorly documented habitats, such as tropical environments. Here we propose a new method, named Multiresolution Analysis of Acoustic Diversity (MAAD), to automate the detection of relevant structure in audio data. MAAD was designed to decompose the acoustic community into few elementary components (soundtypes) based on their time–frequency attributes. First, we used the short-time Fourier transform to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in the time–frequency domain. Then, we characterised these ROIs by (1) estimating the median frequency and (2) by running a 2D wavelet analysis at multiple scales and angles. Finally, we grouped the ROIs using a model-based subspace clustering technique so that ROIs were automatically annotated and clustered into soundtypes. To test the performance of the automatic method, we applied MAAD to two distinct tropical environments in French Guiana, a lowland high rainforest and a rock savanna, and we compared manual and automatic annotations using the adjusted Rand index. The similarity between the manual and automated partitions was high and consistent, indicating that the clusters found are intelligible and can be used for further analysis. Moreover, the weight of the features estimated by the clustering process revealed important information about the structure of the acoustic communities. In particular, the median frequency had the strongest effect on modelling the clusters and on classification performance, suggesting a role in community organisation. The number of clusters found in MAAD can be regarded as an estimation of the soundtype richness in a given environment. MAAD is a comprehensive and promising method to automatically analyse passive acoustic recordings. Combining MAAD and manual analysis would maximally exploit the strengths of both human reasoning and computer algorithms.

abstract = {Automated sound broadcast systems have been used to address a variety of ecological questions, and show great potential as a management tool. Such systems need to be reliable because treatments are often applied in the absence of a human observer and system failure can cause methodological ambiguity. During the breeding seasons of 2012 and 2013, we used a sound broadcast system previously described by Farrell and Campomizzi (2011) in an experiment evaluating the use of post-breeding song in forest-bird habitat selection in southern Indiana, USA. This system incorporates a portable compact disc (CD) player where the play button is permanently depressed using manual compression so that when a timer connects an electrical current to the unit, the CD player automatically starts. Despite exhaustive efforts to find a reliable way to manually compress the play button on numerous CD player models, play button failure was the most significant source of broadcast system failure (88{\%}) in 2012. We attempted to resolve this problem in 2013 by removing the need for manual compression and soldering the play button contact poles on each CD players' integrated circuit boards. Though we did experience broadcast system failures during {\textless}5{\%} of treatment periods in 2013, none of those were attributable to play button failure. By removing all possibility of failure from manual play button compression we improved our system reliability. Thus, soldering the CD player play button on such broadcast systems represents a methodological improvement that can be used by researchers and managers interested in sound broadcast.},

abstract = {A major challenge in the automated acoustic recognition of bird species is the audio segmentation, which aims to select portions of audio that contain meaningful sound events and eliminates segments that contain predominantly background noise or sound events of other origin. Here we report on the development of an audio parameterization method with integrated robust frame selection that makes use of morphological filtering applied on the spectrogram seen as an image. The morphological filtering allows to exclude from further processing certain audio events, which otherwise could cause misclassification errors. The Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) computed for the selected audio frames offer a good representation of the spectral information for dominant vocalizations because the morphological filtering eliminates short bursts of noise and suppresses weak competing signals. Experimental validation of the proposed method on the identification of 40 bird species from Brazil demonstrated superior accuracy and faster operation than three traditional and recent approaches. This is expressed as reduction of the relative error rate by 3.4{\%} and the overall operational time by 7.5{\%} when compared to the second best result. The improved frame selection robustness, precision, and operational speed facilitate applications like multi-species identification of real-field recordings.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an introduction to the physical characteristics of sound, basic recording principles as well as several ways to analyze digital sound files using spectrogram analysis. This paper is designed to be a “primer” which we hope will encourage landscape ecologists to study soundscapes. This primer uses data from a long-term study that are analyzed using common software tools. The paper presents these analyses as exercises. Spectrogram analyses are presented here introducing indices familiar to ecologists (e.g., Shannon's diversity, evenness, dominance) and GIS experts (patch analysis). A supplemental online tutorial provides detailed instructions with step by step directions for these exercises. We discuss specific terms when working with digital sound analysis, comment on the state of the art in acoustic analysis and present recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {The Los Tuxtlas mountain range harbors one of the last remnants of tropical rain forest on the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico. This volcanic range has a high degree of heterogeneity in its geology, climate and ecology, in addition to a very long history of human occupation. The original area covered by tropical forest has been drastically reduced by agricultural activities, and during the last four decades in particular, deforestation has been very intense. In order to protect the remaining forest, in 1998 the Mexican government created the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve (LTBR). While previous studies estimated deforestation rates and the amount of forest cover remaining in some areas of the LTBR, this is the first study to do so for the entire protected area. A retrospective analysis from 1986 to 2011 was conducted to assess the effect of the 1998 decree of the LTBR on deforestation rates, and to predict future changes in forest cover up to the year 2025 using Markov chains and cellular automata based on current deforestation patterns. The results show that shortly after the 1998 decree, deforestation rates in the LTBR not only decreased but reversed, however this trend did not continue. In recent years deforestation has again increased. Our projection shows that if current trends continue unchanged then by the year 2025 we might have lost close to 14{\%} (ca. 9000 ha) of the forest cover that was present in 2011. The decree of the LTBR was part of the federal policy to protect biodiversity in Mexico and our results show that the strategy of establishing this protected area did work to protect tropical forest, at least temporarily in Los Tuxtlas. Also, our results show that it is not only possible to reverse forest loss within the ample buffer zone of the LTBR, it is also still relatively easy to achieve by promoting passive restoration.},

abstract = {The findings of a wildness study are presented where audio-visual stimuli (video footage), were assessed by experimental subjects under controlled conditions, in order to obtain reliable estimates of perceived tranquillity together with a number of other rated qualities including calmness and pleasantness. A wide range of mainly natural scenes totalling 46 were presented including footage from the Scottish Highlands and Dartmoor National Park. The findings clearly demonstrate that rated tranquillity relates closely to rated calmness and pleasantness and this agrees with earlier studies of soundscape categorisation. The effect of adding man-made sounds to the soundscape was shown to seriously degrade perceived tranquillity though ratings of wildness were not nearly as affected. Attempts to improve the level of tranquillity further by adding natural sounds were largely unsuccessful. It was considered important to determine if the previously employed Tranquillity Rating Prediction Tool (TRAPT) successfully validated for mainly urban open spaces could usefully predict tranquility in remote wildland areas. In fact results demonstrated the relatively close relationship between predicted and actually rated tranquillity in these remote areas which further extended the range of validity of the prediction tool. The findings of this study will challenge the notion that characterization of landscapes is purely a visual exercise and that soundscape quality needs to be considered as an integral part of this assessment process. For this reason the findings will be of interest to those responsible for managing and marketing protected areas such as National Parks, practitioners involved in carrying out landscape character assessments, cartographers and landscape architects involved in designing tranquil spaces across a range of scales.},

abstract = {Acoustic localization is a powerful technique for monitoring the positions, movements and behaviours of terrestrial animals. However, its prevalence in biological studies has been constrained by hardware and software that are custom-built, expensive and difficult to use. We recently helped to relieve the hardware constraint by describing a microphone array that is affordable, portable, easy to use and commercially available. Here, we help to relieve the software constraint by developing an acoustic localization program called ?Sound Finder?, which is easy to use, freely available and accurate for a variety of animals and recording conditions. It runs in the free software environment R, and in spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel and the open-source software LibreOffice. In this study, we describe how Sound Finder functions, and then test its accuracy by localizing natural sounds that were broadcast through loudspeakers and re-recorded with microphone arrays. We quantify Sound Finder's accuracy by comparing its location estimates with known loudspeaker locations and with output from other localization approaches. We show that Sound Finder generates accurate location estimates for a variety of animal sounds, microphone array configurations and environmental conditions. Furthermore, Sound Finder generates an error value that allows the user to assess its accuracy. In conclusion, Sound Finder provides accurate estimates of a vocalizing animal's location. It is easy to use, requires only widespread and affordable software and is freely available in a standard form as Supplementary material to this article.},

abstract = {Most evaluations of the effects of human activities on wild animals have focused on estimating changes in abundance and distribution of threatened species; however, ecosystem disturbances also affect aspects of animal behavior such as short-term movement, activity budgets, and reproduction. It may take a long time for changes in behavior to manifest as changes in abundance or distribution. Therefore, it is important to have methods with which to detect short-term behavioral responses to human activity. We used continuous acoustic and seismic monitoring to evaluate the short-term effects of seismic prospecting for oil on forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) in Gabon, Central Africa. We monitored changes in elephant abundance and activity as a function of the frequency and intensity of acoustic and seismic signals from dynamite detonation and human activity. Elephants did not flee the area being explored; the relative number of elephants increased in a seasonal pattern typical of elsewhere in the ecosystem. In the exploration area, however, they became more nocturnal. Neither the intensity nor the frequency of dynamite blasts affected the frequency of calling or the daily pattern of elephant activity. Nevertheless, the shift of activity to nocturnal hours became more pronounced as human activity neared each monitored area of forest. This change in activity pattern and its likely causes would not have been detected through standard monitoring methods, which are not sensitive to behavioral changes over short time scales (e.g., dung transects, point counts) or cover a limited area (e.g., camera traps). Simultaneous acoustic monitoring of animal communication, human, and environmental sounds allows the documentation of short-term behavioral changes in response to human disturbance.},

abstract = {The acoustic signals of shrews (Soricidae) are largely understudied. As shrews are very vocal animals it may be feasible to use acoustic methods in field studies to assess ecological and behavioral data. In this study, we present the first detailed analysis of the twittering calls of six Central European shrew species (. Sorex minutus, Sorex araneus, Neomys fodiens, Neomys anomalus, Crocidura russula and Crocidura leucodon). The analysis is based on over 6000 recorded calls from 121 individuals. Our results indicate that there is a large inter-individual variance and a large inter-specific overlap in the acoustic parameters of the calls. Each species uses a large spectral variety of calls without clear species specific call types. A species identification using the Support Vector Machine method on six species shows 66.2{\%} accuracy; however, a pairwise comparison indicates accuracy between 68.5 and 97.3{\%}. We propose to use acoustic monitoring of shrews in comparative studies to estimate the overall shrew activity. Moreover we suggest using the acoustic identification method in areas with few shrew species where the accuracy of the technique can be eligible.},

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

abstract = {Sound is almost always around us, anywhere, at any time, reaching our ears and stimulating our brains for better or worse. Sound can be the disturbing noise of a drill, a merry little tune sung by a friend, the song of a bird in the morning or a clap of thunder at night. The science of sound, or acoustics, studies all types of sounds and therefore covers a wide range of scientific disciplines, from pure to applied acoustics. Research dealing with acoustics requires a sound to be recorded, analyzed, manipulated and, possibly, changed. This is particularly, but not exclusively, the case in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, two life sciences disciplines that attempt to understand and to eavesdrop on the sound produced by animals. Sound analysis and synthesis can be challenging for students, researchers and practitioners who have few skills in mathematics or physics. However, deciphering the structure of a sound can be useful in behavioral and ecological research – and also very amusing. This book is dedicated to anyone who wants to practice acoustics but does not know much about sound. Acoustic analysis and synthesis are possible, with little effort, using the free and open-source software R with a few specific packages. Combining a bit of theory, a lot of step-by-step examples and a few cases studies, this book shows beginners and experts alike how to record, read, play, decompose, visualize, parametrize, change, and synthesize sound with R, opening a new way of working in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics but also in other acoustic disciplines.},
