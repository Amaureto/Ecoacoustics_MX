abstract = {Active space 1, that distance from the source over which signal amplitude remains above the detection threshold of potential receivers, was de- termined for Red-winged Blackbird (AgeIaius phoeni- ceus) song in an upland pasture near Ithaca, New York. Song amplitude, the rate of signal attenuation, the amplitude of ambient noise, and the sensitivity of redwings to song masked by noise determine active space and were measured in the field: 1. Maximum root-mean-square song amplitude at 1 m from a singing bird ranged from 88.5-93.5 dB SPL (J{\~{}}{\_}+ SE=90.8 +0.21 dB SPL). 2. Close to the source, song attenuates at a rate which closely matches that predicted by spherical spreading (6 dB/doubling of distance) alone. At dis- tances beyond about 30 m, however, excess attenua- tion becomes important (Fig. 4). The rate of attenua- tion varies with relative wind direction (Table 1). 3. Ambient noise level is relatively low in early morning, rises in late morning and afternoon as air turbulence increases, and then drops again in the evening as turbulence decreases (Table 2 and Ap- pendix). Measured on a 4 kHz octave filter scale (center frequency = 4 kHz, octave pass-band = 2.83- 5.66 kHz), noise during one day ranges from 15 dB SPL (at 06:00 h) to 36 dB SPL (at 11:00 h), more than a 10-fold variation in ambient sound pressure. 4. A 3 dB signal to noise ratio is sufficient for detection of song masked by noise in the field (Figs. 5 and 6). Also, redwings are able to detect differences in this ratio as small as 3 dB. 5. In the absence of wind, the maximum active space of redwing song is about 189 m for a signal SPL of 93.5 dB at 1 m. This distance varies with changes in ambient noise level during the day, and with relative wind direction. Maximum measurements of active space corre- spond closely to the maximum distances across 2 indi- vidual upland redwing territories. This suggests that redwing song is adapted in its structure and amplitude at the source to communicate a male's presence throughout the extent of his neighbors' territories.},
